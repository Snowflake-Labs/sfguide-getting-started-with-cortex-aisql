14,1830,2025-01-01 18:10:27.000,I'd appreciate a refund for the unused Saturday ticket (Order #TR789456) or at least credit toward a future event. I've been a loyal customer for three years and have attended over 20 shows through your platform.
29,1462,2025-01-02 02:58:53.000,"Also, quick heads up - there seems to be a glitch in your mobile app where the venue map isn't loading properly for upcoming shows. I've attached another screenshot showing what I'm seeing."
166,177,2025-01-02 05:52:16.000,"While I have you, I wanted to share some feedback about your new mobile app. The dark mode feature is fantastic, and I love how you've organized the electronic music categories into more specific subgenres. However, the payment processing seems slower than before, and twice last week, I was charged twice for the same ticket (though one charge was eventually reversed)."
57,632,2025-01-02 07:45:44.000,"Also, the new paperless ticket system is generally great, but the app has been super glitchy lately. Sometimes it takes forever to load my QR code at the entrance, which was particularly embarrassing at last month's drum & bass night when there was a huge line behind me."
91,1813,2025-01-02 16:09:49.000,"Also, I purchased tickets for the Summer Electronica Festival next month (Order #EF-2023-8867), but realized I double-booked that weekend. What's your refund policy? If a refund isn't possible, I'd be happy to list them on your official resale platform."
149,1320,2025-01-02 18:26:38.000,"Additionally, I wanted to provide some feedback about the new notification system. As someone who primarily listens to indie rock and alternative music, I'm getting bombarded with notifications about country music events. While I appreciate staying informed about upcoming shows, it would be great if the notifications were more tailored to my interests based on my previous ticket purchases or maybe a preference setting I could adjust."
16,466,2025-01-03 00:14:32.000,I'm also wondering if you could clarify your refund policy for postponed events. The FAQ section isn't very clear about this.
128,603,2025-01-04 02:07:15.000,"One suggestion - it would be amazing if you could add a notification system for when our favorite genres are featured in upcoming events. I mainly follow progressive house and techno, and sometimes miss out on great shows because I don't check the website regularly enough."
649,1033,2025-01-04 02:38:30.000,"I urgently need assistance with transferring my ticket, as I have to finalize plans with my sister and time is of the essence."
139,681,2025-01-04 04:57:30.000,"Also, I purchased VIP passes for the summer music series, but my confirmation email shows standard admission. I paid $189.50 for each pass (3 in total), and I'd appreciate if someone could verify this was processed correctly."
571,1035,2025-01-04 07:17:27.000,"Here is the rewritten version:

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue with my recent purchase, which was made on March 15th for a total of $289.50. The ticket reference number for this transaction is TIX-2023-89445."
129,1399,2025-01-05 04:15:04.000,"On a separate note, I processed a refund for the cancelled Electronic Music Festival three weeks ago but haven't received the money back yet. The confirmation number is TXN-2023-89472. Could you please look into this?"
65,1310,2025-01-05 18:39:25.000,"I attended the electronic music festival at Moonlight Gardens last weekend and wanted to share some thoughts. While DJ Starweaver's set was incredible (that bass drop at 1 AM was insane!), I noticed several issues with the venue's sound system during the early acts. There was noticeable distortion coming from the left speaker stack during the first two performances."
15,890,2025-01-06 02:25:38.000,"I attended the Summer Vibes Festival last weekend and need help with a few things. First, my friend and I noticed that our tickets were double-charged (Order #VF-29847 and #VF-29848). I've attached a screenshot of my bank statement showing both charges."
39,66,2025-01-06 05:45:20.000,"Also, heads up - the drink prices shown on your mobile app are different from what's actually being charged at the venue. Last weekend, the app showed $8 for craft beers, but I was charged $12 at the bar."
60,519,2025-01-06 13:37:39.000,"I've been trying to transfer my tickets for next month's jazz festival to my sister since I unfortunately can't make it anymore due to a work commitment. I've spent the last 30 minutes on your website attempting to do this but keep getting an error message (screenshot attached) whenever I click the ""Transfer Tickets"" button. This is really frustrating as these weren't cheap - I paid $175 for the weekend pass!"
103,967,2025-01-06 13:59:30.000,"However, I do find it frustrating that the early bird tickets sell out within seconds. Perhaps implementing a queue system like other venues would make it fairer for regular attendees like myself?"
147,88,2025-01-06 17:35:30.000,"There was also a small issue with the sound system during last week's performance - there was some feedback during the quieter passages that really affected the experience, especially during the piano solos."
89,202,2025-01-06 21:29:48.000,"That said, I absolutely loved the production quality at last week's symphonic metal showcase. The light show during the headline act was mind-blowing! Though I noticed the merch stand's card reader wasn't working properly - might want to look into that for future events."
126,914,2025-01-07 12:54:05.000,I'd appreciate a response within 48 hours as the festival is next weekend.
647,1088,2025-01-08 06:32:12.000,"During last week's show, we encountered a minor technical issue with the sound system, which caused some distracting feedback during the softer moments, particularly noticeable during the piano solos."
163,92,2025-01-08 14:10:16.000,"While I have you, I just wanted to say that the new QR code system you implemented last month is fantastic - so much smoother than the old paper tickets! However, the drink token feature in the app is still quite buggy."
21,1164,2025-01-08 16:48:39.000,"Also, quick question - my payment for the Summer Bass Series (3-event package) shows as ""pending"" in my account for over a week now, but the money has already left my bank account. Could you please check this for me?"
39,1520,2025-01-09 09:24:57.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention that I've been a regular attendee at your monthly jazz nights for the past year, and I particularly love the intimate setting of your basement venue. The acoustics are fantastic! However, lately it feels like these events have become less frequent - we used to have them every first Friday, but the last two months were skipped without notice. Any chance you could keep us updated about scheduling changes through your newsletter?"
549,1111,2025-01-10 01:13:30.000,"I'm experiencing some issues with the new mobile app, specifically with accessing digital tickets. The loading time can be quite slow, taking up to 5 minutes, which can be frustrating, especially when trying to enter an event."
15,607,2025-01-10 19:52:59.000,"This is really frustrating because  I spent $385 on these VIP passes and the festival is in just 10 days. I've been looking forward to seeing the sunset DJ set and that new underground techno artist from Berlin, but my boss just scheduled an unavoidable business trip. I really need to get these tickets transferred ASAP."
30,146,2025-01-10 20:45:21.000,"I purchased 2 VIP tickets ($189 each) under booking reference MF2023-45721. Given that the event is in 3 weeks, I'm getting quite anxious about this issue. I really need to transfer these tickets as I unfortunately can't attend anymore due to a family wedding."
131,325,2025-01-11 06:57:25.000,"Lastly, I attempted to get a refund for the ""Urban Beats Festival"" tickets (purchased on Dec 15th) within your 48-hour window, but my request was denied. I have screenshots of the confirmation email showing the purchase time and my refund request submission."
82,268,2025-01-11 14:52:01.000,"I've been trying to get this sorted out for days and I'm getting quite frustrated. I purchased 4 VIP tickets for the upcoming Summer Groove Festival on July 15th for my family, but the payment went through twice (I've attached a screenshot of both charges from my bank statement). While I appreciate the quick confirmation email for the first payment, I need the second charge of $899.50 refunded ASAP."
530,1146,2025-01-12 23:47:28.000,"I'm reaching out about my VIP ticket purchase (MF2023-45721, $189 each) as I'm facing an urgent issue. With the event just three weeks away, I'm getting anxious about resolving this. Due to unforeseen family commitments, specifically a wedding, I'm no longer able to attend and I desperately need assistance with transferring these tickets."
129,989,2025-01-13 11:04:51.000,"Lastly, there seems to be a discrepancy in my account regarding a refund from the canceled Jazz & Soul event last month. The email said it would be processed within 5-7 business days, but it's been two weeks now. Could you please look into this? I've attached a screenshot of my original purchase confirmation for reference."
17,151,2025-01-13 11:36:57.000,"One last thing - the event schedule shows performances starting at 2 PM, but your Instagram post from yesterday mentioned 3 PM. Could you confirm the correct start time?"
46,303,2025-01-13 21:20:15.000,"While I'm here, I'd also like to mention that I love how you've increased the frequency of Latin jazz performances lately - they're always a highlight! That said, the sound quality during last week's performance was a bit off, with too much bass drowning out the horn section. Just thought you should know."
102,1090,2025-01-14 10:05:59.000,"This is particularly frustrating because I spent $289 on this ticket, and now that I can't make it due to a family wedding, I really need to get this sorted. Sarah is a massive techno fan and she's dying to see DJ Starlight's set."
106,208,2025-01-15 01:13:59.000,"I attended last weekend's indie folk festival at Riverbank Arena and wanted to share my experience. While the acoustics were fantastic and I particularly enjoyed the sunset performance on the Garden Stage, I encountered some issues with the mobile ticketing system. During entry, the QR code wouldn't load properly due to poor reception (screenshot attached), causing a 20-minute delay. Several other attendees faced similar problems."
71,35,2025-01-15 02:22:53.000,"The ticket reference number is TIX-2023-89445, purchased on March 15th for $289.50."
137,683,2025-01-15 09:30:23.000,"I attended your indie rock festival last weekend and while the music was incredible (especially that new underground band with the amazing female guitarist!), I'm having issues with getting my VIP ticket refund processed. I was originally supposed to attend with my boyfriend, but we had to leave early on Day 2 due to a family emergency."
666,1177,2025-01-15 17:46:35.000,"I've been enjoying the updates to your mobile app, particularly the dark mode and the more detailed electronic music subgenres. However, I've noticed that the payment processing seems to be taking a bit longer than it used to. Additionally, I've experienced an issue with duplicate charges on two separate occasions last week, although one of the charges was eventually refunded."
150,434,2025-01-15 21:59:07.000,"Firstly, the payment for my VIP upgrade seems to have been charged twice to my credit card. I've attached a screenshot of both transactions from my bank statement. The duplicate charge is for $149.99."
507,1182,2025-01-15 22:42:40.000,"I recently attended the electronic music festival at Starlight Arena and had a mixed experience. The sound system was top-notch for the deep house performances, but I found the bass to be overpowering during the techno sets, particularly near the west stage. I've included a video clip that captures the speaker distortion I encountered."
97,1454,2025-01-16 00:50:16.000,"While I've got your attention, I also  wanted to mention that I love what you're doing with the new underground electronic music series. The monthly frequency is perfect, and as someone who's really into experimental techno and ambient, it's refreshing to see these genres getting proper representation. However, the sound system at The Blue Room venue could use some improvement, especially for the bass-heavy sets."
32,1416,2025-01-16 02:37:16.000,"On a different note, I accidentally purchased two tickets for the upcoming experimental electronic show next month (screenshot of double booking attached). Is it possible to get a refund for one of them? Order #RT789321."
138,610,2025-01-17 06:43:54.000,"I attended the electronic music festival last weekend at Sunset Arena and had mixed feelings about the experience. While the music selection was fantastic (especially loving the deep house and techno sets), I noticed the sound quality at Stage 3 was quite poor - there was constant distortion during peak moments. I've attached a video showing the audio issues."
589,1202,2025-01-17 09:33:25.000,"I had an amazing time at the symphonic metal showcase last week, the production quality was top-notch! The light show during the headliner's performance was truly breathtaking. One minor suggestion for improvement: the card reader at the merchandise stand was a bit temperamental, so it might be worth checking that for future events."
606,1208,2025-01-18 03:07:54.000,"I recently attended the indie folk festival at Riverbank Arena and had a mixed experience. The acoustics were top-notch, and the sunset show on the Garden Stage was a highlight. However, I ran into trouble with the mobile ticketing system when trying to enter the venue. The QR code failed to load due to weak signal strength (see attached screenshot), resulting in a 20-minute wait. Unfortunately, I wasn't the only one - several other festival-goers experienced similar issues."
99,940,2025-01-18 14:18:23.000,"I spent over $450 on these tickets, and I'd really appreciate some clarification on these issues. The duplicate charge needs to be refunded ASAP, and I'd like to know what exactly my VIP benefits include."
52,664,2025-01-18 17:48:24.000,"The mobile app is quite buggy too - it crashes whenever I try to view my ticket barcode. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but no luck. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I'm getting."
517,1228,2025-01-19 12:50:35.000,I'd greatly appreciate it if you could assist me with resolving two issues: the ticket transfer and the duplicate payment. Thank you for your time and for all your efforts in supporting the local music scene.
88,743,2025-01-19 14:59:17.000,"I'm having a really frustrating experience with my recent ticket purchase for the upcoming Summer Jazz Fusion Festival. I bought 4 VIP tickets last Thursday (order #RT789321), but I've been charged twice for the same order! I've attached a screenshot of both transactions from my bank statement."
164,1843,2025-01-19 17:00:48.000,"I purchased two VIP tickets for the upcoming electronic music festival ""Neon Dreams"" on June 15th, but I've encountered several issues I need help with. First, when I try to access my tickets through the mobile app, I keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). I've tried logging out and back in, but no luck."
144,816,2025-01-19 20:26:12.000,"Could you please help me sort out this transfer issue ASAP? Mike needs to book his flights soon, and I'd hate for these tickets to go to waste. The confirmation number for my purchase is TM789456."
45,236,2025-01-19 21:21:01.000,"Additionally, I purchased VIP tickets ($225 each) for my girlfriend and me, but the VIP area was overcrowded and many amenities mentioned in the package (private bar access, complimentary welcome drink) were unavailable. When I spoke with the event staff, they seemed unaware of these promised benefits."
64,1575,2025-01-19 22:35:55.000,"I attended last Friday's jazz fusion concert at your venue and wanted to share my experience. While the musicianship was exceptional (especially that mind-blowing saxophone solo in the second set!), I noticed the sound system had significant distortion during the louder passages. I've attached a video clip showing the issue during one particular moment."
7,182,2025-01-20 07:36:57.000,"I attended last night's electronic music festival at Starlight Arena and wanted to share some mixed feedback. While the sound system was incredible for the deep house sets, I noticed the bass was overwhelming during the techno portion, especially near the west stage. I've attached a short video clip showing the speaker distortion I experienced."
95,671,2025-01-20 11:21:05.000,"Also, there seems to be an issue with your mobile app's notification system. I've enabled notifications but haven't received any alerts about upcoming electronic music shows, which I specifically marked as my preferred genre."
4,1581,2025-01-20 11:59:34.000,"I've been attending shows at your venue for the past 2 years and absolutely love the indie rock scene you've cultivated. However, I'm really frustrated with my recent experience trying to transfer tickets for the upcoming Underground Echoes festival. I purchased 4 VIP tickets ($225 each) for my friends and me, but two of them can't make it anymore due to a family emergency."
138,1606,2025-01-20 13:12:26.000,"Also, I purchased tickets for the Summer Jazz Festival (Order #JF-89076), but the confirmation email shows seats in Section C, Row 12, while I specifically selected and paid for Section A, Row 5. Could you please look into this discrepancy?"
41,374,2025-01-21 04:49:29.000,"I attended your pop-soul fusion concert last Friday at Valley Arena, and while the acoustics were phenomenal, I'm having some issues with my VIP add-on purchase. I bought 2 meet-and-greet passes for $175 each, but they're not showing up in my account. I've attached a screenshot of my payment confirmation (see payment_proof.jpg), but the purchase isn't reflected in my ticket wallet."
5,1129,2025-01-21 11:03:50.000,"One more thing - I purchased tickets for the upcoming World Beat Festival, but accidentally bought 3 instead of 2. I've been trying to get a refund for the extra ticket for the past week. The automated system keeps saying my request is being processed, but I haven't heard anything back."
9,948,2025-01-21 18:08:33.000,"I'm reaching out regarding several frustrating issues I've experienced with your platform lately. First off, the electronic payment for my VIP pass to the upcoming Summer Beat Festival keeps getting declined, even though I've triple-checked that all my card details are correct. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep receiving."
59,441,2025-01-22 06:23:44.000,"I've been a loyal customer for years and usually attend at least 3-4 of your underground house music events each month. The recent switch to this new system has been nothing but headaches. Last month, I also had issues with the mobile tickets not displaying properly during the indie rock showcase."
49,111,2025-01-22 20:49:01.000,"Also, quick feedback - the new mobile app is quite buggy when trying to access the digital tickets. Sometimes it takes up to 5 minutes to load, which caused some anxiety at the entrance last time."
65,1096,2025-01-23 03:56:12.000,"I've been a loyal customer of your platform for years, mostly attending electronic and techno events. Last weekend's experience at Warehouse 42 left me quite frustrated though. I purchased 4 VIP tickets for my friends and myself (Order #8742196) for the Spring Bass Festival, but when we arrived, the QR codes wouldn't scan properly. I've attached a screenshot of the error message we received."
8,497,2025-01-23 04:00:19.000,"I recently attended the Neon Dreams concert at your downtown venue, and the sound system seemed a bit off - there was too much bass drowning out the vocals. I've been to many shows there before and this was the first time I noticed this issue."
582,1268,2025-01-23 13:59:44.000,"I'm extremely frustrated as I've been trying to resolve this issue for days. I bought 4 VIP tickets to the Summer Groove Festival on July 15th for my family, but somehow I was charged twice (I've attached a screenshot of the duplicate charges from my bank statement). Although I received a prompt confirmation email for the initial payment, I urgently need the second charge of $899.50 to be refunded."
81,1432,2025-01-23 15:17:11.000,"I'd appreciate if you could:
1. Refund the duplicate charge ASAP
2. Confirm my original 4 VIP tickets are still valid
3. Let me know if there are plans for additional stages"
29,931,2025-01-23 17:21:31.000,"Also, small suggestion - it would be great if the water stations near the main stage could be more clearly marked. We spent almost 20 minutes trying to find one during peak hours."
110,1032,2025-01-24 09:12:41.000,"I'm writing because I recently attended the ""Midnight Symphony"" concert last weekend, and while most aspects were amazing (especially the brass section!), I've noticed I was charged twice for my ticket purchase. I've attached a screenshot of both transactions from my credit card statement showing the duplicate charge of $89.50 each from March 15th."
149,33,2025-01-24 18:50:09.000,"Please help me with the ticket transfer issue as soon as possible, as I need to confirm arrangements with my sister."
17,228,2025-01-24 19:39:09.000,Could you please help me sort out both the ticket transfer and the duplicate payment issue? I appreciate your time and everything you do to keep the music scene vibrant in our city.
4,968,2025-01-25 20:48:18.000,"Secondly, the VIP area was completely overcrowded - nothing like what was advertised. We literally couldn't access the premium bar that was promised in the VIP package. I'm hoping you can either partially refund the VIP upgrade fee or offer some compensation for future events."
113,300,2025-01-25 23:02:27.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention that I've noticed fewer jazz events being scheduled lately. As someone who's been attending your venues for the past 3 years, particularly for jazz and blues nights, it's been disappointing to see them becoming less frequent. The intimate setting at your downtown location is perfect for these genres, and the acoustics are fantastic. Any chance you'll be bringing back more jazz programming?"
546,1303,2025-01-26 07:24:54.000,"I appreciate the recent surge in Latin jazz events, they're always a standout. However, I did notice that the sound balance was off during last week's show, with the bass overpowering the horns. I wanted to bring it to your attention."
81,1861,2025-01-26 15:55:58.000,"I'm really frustrated and need urgent assistance. I purchased 4 VIP tickets for the upcoming ""Midnight Symphony"" festival on July 15th, but I've been charged twice for the same order (confirmation numbers: MF-2023-89421 and MF-2023-89422). I've attached a screenshot of both transactions from my bank statement."
58,777,2025-01-26 19:20:11.000,"One last thing - my payment for the upcoming blues workshop showed as ""pending"" for a week now. Order #RT789321. Could you please check if everything went through correctly?"
64,314,2025-01-27 01:37:36.000,"One quick question - for the summer concert series, will there be any options to convert my individual show tickets into a season pass? I've already purchased tickets to 4 shows, and it would be great if there's a way to upgrade."
631,1325,2025-01-27 17:01:24.000,"I recently tried to obtain a refund for my ""Urban Beats Festival"" tickets, which I bought on December 15th, within the 48-hour refund window. However, my request was rejected. I have documentation, including a confirmation email with the purchase timestamp and proof of my refund request submission, to support my claim."
71,326,2025-01-27 18:01:17.000,"Also, while I have your attention - I noticed that similar electronic music festivals in our area seem to be scheduled very close together this summer. Last year they were more spread out, which made it easier for fans like me to attend multiple events. Any chance you could consider spacing them out more next year?"
6,1614,2025-01-28 05:06:10.000,"Also, quick heads up - the mobile app has been crashing whenever I try to access my digital tickets. Not sure if others are experiencing this too?"
68,1374,2025-01-28 07:18:36.000,"One last thing - the new mobile app is quite buggy when trying to access the digital tickets. Sometimes it takes up to 5 minutes to load, which caused me to miss the opening act last week. Not fun when you're standing in line in the rain!"
60,618,2025-01-28 12:50:41.000,Quick heads up - there seems to be an issue with your mobile app too. The upcoming events calendar isn't syncing properly with my purchased tickets. Might want to have your tech team look into that.
153,334,2025-01-28 13:03:20.000,"Also, I noticed the frequency of weekend events has decreased significantly since September. Are you planning to bring back more Saturday night shows? The 7 PM time slots were perfect for those of us who like to enjoy a full concert experience but still need to get up early for work the next day."
110,1092,2025-01-28 18:03:37.000,"Also, there seems to be an issue with the drink tokens I pre-purchased for last month's show - they're still showing as ""pending"" in my account. I have the payment confirmation from my bank (screenshot attached)."
71,653,2025-01-29 03:35:28.000,"I also experienced some issues with the sound quality during last month's electronic music showcase - the bass was overwhelming in the back section where the VIP area was located. Several others mentioned this too, so might be worth looking into."
49,908,2025-01-29 06:18:01.000,"On a more positive note, your new mobile app is much better than the old one, though I noticed the 'Save to Calendar' feature isn't working properly on Android devices (second screenshot attached showing the error)."
60,345,2025-01-29 10:16:59.000,"While I have your attention - I absolutely love what you guys are doing with the new jazz series! I'm a huge bebop fan, and it's amazing to see some up-and-coming artists getting spotlight. However, I noticed the intervals between shows have gotten longer. Any chance you could bring back the bi-weekly schedule? The monthly gaps are killing me! 😭"

504,2581,2025-05-06 20:52:43.000,"I've been a loyal fan of your venue's indie rock scene for the past 2 years, but my latest experience with transferring tickets for the Underground Echoes festival has been a letdown. I bought 4 VIP tickets ($225 each) for my friends and me, but unfortunately, two of them are no longer able to attend due to unforeseen family circumstances."
134,1389,2025-05-07 23:54:02.000,"I've been having issues with transferring my tickets for next month's jazz fusion concert at The Blue Room. I purchased 3 tickets last week under my account (order #RT789321), but I need to transfer 2 of them to my friends since they'll be arriving separately. I've tried using the transfer function on your mobile app several times, but it keeps showing an ""Invalid Recipient Error"" message (screenshot attached). The error appears right after I enter my friend's email address, indicating that the email addresses might not be registered in the system or may contain formatting errors. I've double-checked the email addresses multiple times, but the transfer still fails to process."
638,2606,2025-05-08 15:45:42.000,"I recently purchased tickets for the Summer Jazz Festival (Order #JF-89076), but there seems to be an error with my seat assignment. According to my confirmation email, I've been allocated seats in Section C, Row 12, whereas I had chosen and paid for seats in Section A, Row 5. I would greatly appreciate it if you could investigate and resolve this issue."
506,2614,2025-05-09 11:45:10.000,I'm having trouble with the mobile app - it keeps crashing every time I try to view my digital tickets. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?
138,1762,2025-05-09 18:01:58.000,"I've been experiencing some frustrating issues with my ticket transfer for the upcoming Dark Symphony concert at Riverside Hall. I attempted to transfer my VIP ticket to my sister three times now, but keep getting an error message saying ""Transfer Failed - Error Code 2468"" (screenshot attached). This is quite urgent as I'm no longer able to attend due to a family emergency, and she's traveling from out of state for this."
49,1624,2025-05-10 11:53:29.000,"However, I'm a bit disappointed with the recent price increase for the VIP packages. As someone who's been a loyal customer for three years (mostly for your jazz and world music events), I feel the 30% jump is quite steep, especially since the perks haven't changed."
39,110,2025-05-13 23:14:32.000,"I've been a loyal attendee of your events for the past 3 years, particularly loving the techno and house music stages. Last year's underground warehouse series was absolutely incredible - the intimate venue setting really enhanced the whole vibe! However, I've noticed you've reduced the frequency of your underground events from bi-weekly to monthly. Any chance you'll bring back the more frequent schedule? The community really misses the regular meetups."
77,1669,2025-05-14 15:48:50.000,"One more thing - the new digital ticket scanning system at the entrance was super smooth at last week's jazz night, but could you consider adding more scanning stations? The queue got pretty lengthy around 8 PM."
42,1008,2025-05-14 17:46:32.000,"First, I purchased 4 tickets but was only able to transfer 3 to my friends. The fourth ticket keeps showing a ""Transfer failed - try again later"" error when I try to send it (I've attached a screenshot of the error message). The system seems to be timing out during the transfer process, and despite multiple attempts over the past hour, I keep getting the same error message. Could you please help me resolve this? My friend needs the ticket ASAP as we're all traveling from different cities."
101,1709,2025-05-18 06:18:59.000,"Also, I noticed the ticket prices for the summer series have increased quite significantly. While I understand costs go up, a 40% jump seems quite steep. Any chance you could consider introducing a loyalty program for regular attendees? I must have been to at least 15 of your events last year alone!"
68,496,2025-05-19 05:05:49.000,"I've been having issues with the ticket transfer for next month's jazz festival. Despite following the instructions, when I try to transfer my VIP pass to my sister's account, I keep getting an error message saying ""transfer limit reached"" (screenshot attached). This is frustrating because I haven't made any transfers before, and I specifically bought these tickets knowing I might need to transfer them."
6,679,2025-05-20 11:59:22.000,"I've been having an incredibly frustrating experience with my ticket transfer for the upcoming Electronic Paradise Festival. I tried transferring my VIP pass to my sister's account three times now, but keep getting an error message saying ""Transfer failed - recipient not found"" (screenshot attached). I've double-checked her email address multiple times, and it's definitely correct."
86,231,2025-05-20 17:31:12.000,"While I'm here, I'd also like to mention that the frequency of trance events in your venue has decreased significantly over the past year. As someone who regularly attended your Thursday night trance sessions, I miss having a consistent spot to enjoy this genre. The new focus on pop-up jazz nights is great for variety, but perhaps you could consider alternating between genres?"
11,1734,2025-05-20 22:14:46.000,"Could you please:
1. Help me transfer these tickets promptly
2. Explain why the jazz nights have been reduced
3. Consider offering partial refunds for annual members affected by the programming changes"
93,1745,2025-05-21 18:17:28.000,One more thing - the VIP lounge map on your website seems outdated. It still shows the old layout from last year's setup. Will the premium viewing deck still be in the same location?
118,1754,2025-05-22 06:58:57.000,"I've tried logging out and back in, clearing my cache, and even using a different browser, but nothing seems to work. Could you please help me sort this out ASAP? My sister needs to make travel arrangements, and time is getting a bit tight."
43,935,2025-05-22 18:40:18.000,"I recently attended your underground techno event at The Underground Room last Friday, and while the music was absolutely incredible (especially that deep house set around midnight!), I'm having some issues with getting a refund for my friend's ticket. She couldn't make it last minute due to a family emergency, and I tried using your ticket transfer system, but kept getting an error message. I've attached a screenshot of the error page for your reference."
151,1773,2025-05-23 04:24:24.000,"Also, I noticed that the new membership tier system is a bit unclear - particularly regarding early access benefits. For example, I'm a Gold member but somehow wasn't able to access the pre-sale for the ""Midnight Symphony"" show last week, despite the membership benefits page stating all Gold members get pre-sale access."
98,949,2025-05-24 12:33:16.000,"Back to my main issue though - could you please help me with the ticket transfer? I keep getting a ""Transfer Not Available for This Event"" error message when I try to send them through the app. I've already promised these tickets to my sister and don't want to let her down. I've attempted the transfer multiple times, but the system won't let me proceed with the transfer process."
62,1796,2025-05-25 02:27:48.000,"Could you please:
1. Help me transfer 2 tickets
2. Confirm if there are plans for more frequent events
3. Double-check that the duplicate charge was fully reversed"
591,2813,2025-05-26 12:35:37.000,"I recently bought tickets to the Summer Electronica Festival scheduled for next month (Order #EF-2023-8867), but I've encountered a scheduling conflict. Could you please inform me about your refund process? If a refund isn't an option, I'd be interested in reselling the tickets through your official resale platform."
514,2830,2025-05-28 01:51:18.000,"I'm requesting a refund for the unused Saturday ticket (Order #TR789456) or a credit towards a future event. As a loyal customer of three years, having attended over 20 shows through your platform, I would appreciate it if you could accommodate this request."
83,1831,2025-05-28 02:33:08.000,"One more thing - is there any way to get a partial refund for the Classical Series subscription? I know it's clearly stated as non-refundable, but I'm moving overseas in September and will miss the last three concerts. I've been a premium member since day one, if that helps at all..."

132,415,2025-05-28 23:32:27.000,"Also, while I'm writing - I noticed that your electronic/EDM events have become less frequent lately. As someone who's been following your venue for the past 3 years and absolutely lives for drum & bass nights, it's been disappointing to see fewer shows in this genre. The underground scene here really needs more representation! "
130,1853,2025-05-29 19:46:23.000,"Secondly, the event page initially advertised early entry for VIP ticket holders starting at 2 PM, but when we arrived, security told us entry wouldn't begin until 3:30 PM. We waited in the hot sun for nothing! As someone who particularly wanted to catch the opening folk-fusion acts, this was really disappointing."
581,2861,2025-05-30 08:27:35.000,"I'm experiencing a pressing issue that requires immediate attention. I recently bought 4 VIP tickets to the ""Midnight Symphony"" festival on July 15th, but I've been double-charged for the same order (order numbers: MF-2023-89421 and MF-2023-89422). I've included a screenshot from my bank statement showing both transactions for your reference."

These tickets weren't cheap ($89 each), and I really need to get them to her since I can't make it anymore due to a work commitment."
