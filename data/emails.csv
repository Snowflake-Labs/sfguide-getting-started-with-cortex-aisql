106,596,2025-02-18 12:06:56.000,"Also, while I have your attention - I noticed you've reduced the frequency of your jazz fusion events at The Blue Room. The monthly sessions used to be a highlight, but now they're only quarterly. Any chance of bringing them back to a monthly schedule? The intimate venue and quality of musicians you book really set these apart from other jazz events in the city."
71,685,2025-02-25 01:37:07.000,"I've been trying to transfer my VIP tickets for the upcoming Summer Beats Festival to my sister since I unexpectedly need to travel for work that weekend. I've attempted the transfer through your app three times now, but keep getting an error message saying ""Transfer failed - Error code 2468"" (screenshot attached). This is really frustrating as these weren't cheap tickets, and the festival is only 10 days away!"
97,211,2025-01-18 15:33:46.000,"I recently attended the electronic music festival ""VibeWave"" and had both positive and negative experiences I wanted to share. First off, the sound quality at the Desert Stage was phenomenal - whoever handled the audio engineering deserves a raise! The bass frequencies during the midnight techno sets were perfect."
97,195,2025-01-16 21:49:48.000,"However, I'm writing mainly because I'm having issues with ticket transfers. I bought 4 VIP passes ($289 each) for next month's show, but two of my friends can't make it anymore. I've tried transferring the tickets through your app for the past 3 days, but keep getting an ""Error 506"" message (screenshot attached). I've also noticed the transfer button is grayed out sometimes."
38,1062,2025-03-27 08:57:43.000,"I attended last weekend's indie folk festival at Meadowlands Arena and wanted to share my experience. While most aspects were fantastic (especially that emerging artist with the cello - wow!), I've encountered some issues with my VIP ticket refund. I purchased 3 VIP passes at $189 each, but was unable to access the promised meet-and-greet area. The staff kept saying my wristband was for general admission only, despite showing them my confirmation email."
150,1023,2025-03-24 07:29:02.000,"I attended the electronic music festival ""Neon Dreams"" last weekend and had some mixed experiences I wanted to share. While DJ Sparkwave's set was absolutely incredible (I'm a huge future bass fan!), I encountered several issues that I hope you can address."
163,394,2025-02-02 05:10:11.000,"On a positive note, the sound quality was impeccable, and I particularly enjoyed the experimental pieces that blended traditional jazz with electronic elements. As someone who's been following the contemporary jazz scene for 15+ years, I could really appreciate the innovative approach."
15,1193,2025-04-07 04:10:45.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to share some feedback about the event scheduling. As someone who's really into indie folk and alternative rock, I found it frustrating that most of the similar-genre acts were performing simultaneously on different stages. Had to miss some of my favorite performers because of this overlap."
13,343,2025-01-29 01:12:50.000,The new mobile app layout is much better - kudos to your design team!
89,53,2025-01-05 09:28:32.000,"While I have your attention, I also wanted to mention that it would be great if you could book more drum and bass artists. The few dnb shows you've hosted this year were absolutely incredible, especially that warehouse party in March. The acoustics in that venue were perfect for the heavy bass lines!"
111,1429,2025-04-25 05:13:26.000,"I absolutely love the lineup this year, especially since you're featuring more techno and deep house artists. The underground warehouse stage additions look incredible! However, I really need to get this transfer sorted ASAP."
58,911,2025-03-15 19:05:18.000,"I've been having ongoing issues with my ticket transfer for the upcoming jazz festival at Waterside Arena on July 15th. I've attempted to transfer my VIP pass to my sister's account three times now, but keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). The error occurs right after I enter her email and click ""confirm transfer."" This is particularly frustrating as I  paid $289 for this ticket, and the event is just two weeks away."
135,352,2025-01-30 00:37:38.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that I love how you've been bringing more fusion artists to the venue lately, but I wish there were more early evening shows during the week. Some of us have to be up early for work!"
81,1861,2025-05-30 08:27:35.000,"I'm really frustrated and need urgent assistance. I purchased 4 VIP tickets for the upcoming ""Midnight Symphony"" festival on July 15th, but I've been charged twice for the same order (confirmation numbers: MF-2023-89421 and MF-2023-89422). I've attached a screenshot of both transactions from my bank statement."
23,118,2025-01-10 18:42:45.000,"First, I've been trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming Bass Revolution Festival to my friend Sarah since I can't make it anymore due to a family emergency. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep getting when I try to use the transfer feature on your app. It just keeps loading endlessly after I enter her email."
51,1058,2025-03-26 23:59:35.000,"While I appreciate the increased focus on indie rock (the Underground Echoes series has been fantastic!), perhaps you could consider alternating genres more evenly throughout the week? The jazz community here is quite active, and we'd love to see more representation."
78,1659,2025-05-13 12:25:27.000,"On another note, I'm having trouble with my ticket transfer for next month's blues festival. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep getting when trying to transfer my VIP pass to my sister. The system keeps saying ""invalid recipient email"" even though I've triple-checked the address. I need this sorted out ASAP as I unfortunately can't make it due to a work commitment, and she's really looking forward to seeing the headlining act."
55,504,2025-02-11 07:03:39.000,"I've been trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming electronic music festival on Oct 15th but keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). Every time I click ""Transfer to Friend"" the loading circle just spins endlessly. I've tried both on Chrome and Safari with no luck. These are VIP tickets that cost me $450 each, and I need to transfer them to my cousin ASAP since I can no longer attend due to a family wedding."
11,160,2025-01-14 07:15:33.000,"I've attempted this multiple times over the past 24 hours with no success. This is particularly frustrating as I've just been called away for an unexpected business trip, and these tickets weren't cheap. Your events are usually the highlight of my month - especially the Thursday night singer-songwriter sessions - but this technical issue is really disappointing."
64,38,2025-01-04 11:54:33.000,"Lastly, a suggestion - have you considered hosting some indie folk nights? There's a gap in the market for this genre in our area, and your intimate setting would be perfect for acoustic sessions."
150,380,2025-02-01 03:09:45.000,"On a positive note, the new mobile ticket transfer system worked flawlessly when I needed to send a ticket to my friend. However, the QR code seemed a bit glitchy under direct sunlight (screenshot attached of the error message I received)."
93,1745,2025-05-21 18:17:28.000,One more thing - the VIP lounge map on your website seems outdated. It still shows the old layout from last year's setup. Will the premium viewing deck still be in the same location?
92,1697,2025-05-17 09:22:31.000,"I've been a regular attendee of events at your venue and I absolutely love the indie rock nights you host! However, I've noticed that these events have become less frequent over the past few months - we used to have them every Friday, but now they seem to be only once or twice a month."
77,1669,2025-05-14 15:48:50.000,"One more thing - the new digital ticket scanning system at the entrance was super smooth at last week's jazz night, but could you consider adding more scanning stations? The queue got pretty lengthy around 8 PM."
138,1606,2025-05-08 15:45:42.000,"Also, I purchased tickets for the Summer Jazz Festival (Order #JF-89076), but the confirmation email shows seats in Section C, Row 12, while I specifically selected and paid for Section A, Row 5. Could you please look into this discrepancy?"
138,333,2025-01-28 12:02:51.000,"I've been having an incredibly frustrating experience with my ticket transfer for the upcoming Electronic Dreamscape Festival. I tried transferring my VIP pass to my sister's account three times now, but keep getting an error message saying ""Transfer Failed - Error Code 2468"" (screenshot attached). This is especially stressful since I just found out I have a mandatory work conference that weekend."
56,1440,2025-04-25 23:41:30.000,"Also, while I have your attention - I noticed you've reduced the frequency of your underground bass music events at The Echo Chamber venue. These intimate shows were my favorite way to discover new artists, and the monthly schedule was perfect. Any chance you'll bring back the regular schedule?"
60,618,2025-02-20 09:53:30.000,Quick heads up - there seems to be an issue with your mobile app too. The upcoming events calendar isn't syncing properly with my purchased tickets. Might want to have your tech team look into that.
90,1378,2025-04-20 07:52:29.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention how much I love the new jazz series you've been hosting on Thursday nights. The intimate venue setting is perfect for that type of music. However, I think the scheduling could be better - having shows start at 7:30 PM is a bit early for those of us coming straight from work. Would you consider pushing the start time to 8:15 PM? I really want to attend more shows but keep missing the first few songs."
134,1105,2025-03-30 02:18:33.000,"While I'm writing, I just wanted to mention that I really love what you've been doing with the Thursday night local artist showcases. I'm a huge ambient electronic music fan, and it's been awesome discovering new artists in that space. However, I noticed they've become less frequent lately - they used to be weekly, but now seem to happen only twice a month. Any chance of bringing them back to a weekly schedule?"
95,1758,2025-05-22 10:32:53.000,"I attended your jazz concert series at Downtown Hall last Friday and wanted to share both some concerns and positive feedback. The saxophonist was absolutely phenomenal - I've been following jazz for 20+ years, and her improvisations during the second set were mind-blowing. However, I'm writing because I've encountered issues with transferring my tickets for the upcoming blues night to my sister."
152,969,2025-03-19 06:44:33.000,"Also, while I have your attention - any chance you could increase the frequency of jazz events? I noticed you only host jazz nights once every two months, and they always sell out super quickly. The last bebop session was incredible, and I'd love to see more of that style."
65,751,2025-03-03 11:39:42.000,"Also, I've been a regular attendee at your monthly trance nights for over two years now, but lately, they seem to be happening less frequently. Any chance you could bring them back to a weekly schedule? The community really misses the regular meetups, and the underground trance scene here needs more consistent events."
106,1615,2025-05-09 14:12:40.000,"On a positive note, I love the new digital wallet feature you've added. Being able to store all my tickets in one place is super convenient."
39,66,2025-01-06 05:45:20.000,"Also, heads up - the drink prices shown on your mobile app are different from what's actually being charged at the venue. Last weekend, the app showed $8 for craft beers, but I was charged $12 at the bar."
113,612,2025-02-19 18:10:05.000,"Don't mean to dump all these issues at once, but I figure it's better to consolidate them in one email. The ticket transfer is the most urgent though - Sarah needs to book her flight soon if she's going to make it to the festival!"
121,1604,2025-05-08 12:36:48.000,"I'm reaching out because I've been experiencing some frustrating issues with my ticket transfer for next month's Electronic Beats Festival. I tried transferring my VIP ticket to my sister's account three times now, but keep getting an error message saying ""Transfer failed - recipient not found"" (screenshot attached). I've double-checked her email address, and it's definitely correct."
150,434,2025-02-04 16:06:21.000,"Firstly, the payment for my VIP upgrade seems to have been charged twice to my credit card. I've attached a screenshot of both transactions from my bank statement. The duplicate charge is for $149.99."
104,1191,2025-04-06 23:39:49.000,"I attended your underground techno event last Saturday at the warehouse venue, and while the music selection was phenomenal (especially that dark industrial set around 2 AM!), I've noticed the events have become less frequent lately. As someone who's been following your events for the past 2 years, we used to get 2-3 events per month, but now it's down to maybe one every 6 weeks?"
68,496,2025-02-10 17:37:35.000,"I've been having issues with the ticket transfer for next month's jazz festival. Despite following the instructions, when I try to transfer my VIP pass to my sister's account, I keep getting an error message saying ""transfer limit reached"" (screenshot attached). This is frustrating because I haven't made any transfers before, and I specifically bought these tickets knowing I might need to transfer them."
159,973,2025-03-19 15:05:01.000,"I'd really appreciate your help with the ticket transfer issue. My confirmation number is MT789321, and my sister's email is connected to an existing account in your system."
137,391,2025-02-01 22:20:50.000,"On a separate note, my friend Jake attended last week's show and said the new queueing system was much better - kudos to your team for that improvement!"
86,301,2025-01-26 01:23:47.000,"Could you please help me with:
1. Resolving the ticket transfer issue
2. Confirming if the VIP perks are transferable
3. If transfer isn't possible, what are my refund options?"
164,1843,2025-05-28 20:18:00.000,"I purchased two VIP tickets for the upcoming electronic music festival ""Neon Dreams"" on June 15th, but I've encountered several issues I need help with. First, when I try to access my tickets through the mobile app, I keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). I've tried logging out and back in, but no luck."
28,315,2025-01-27 01:52:31.000,"Please help me sort out this transfer issue as soon as possible, as the event is next week."
62,1796,2025-05-25 02:27:48.000,"Could you please:
1. Help me transfer 2 tickets
2. Confirm if there are plans for more frequent events
3. Double-check that the duplicate charge was fully reversed"
88,1497,2025-04-30 13:45:28.000,"Additionally, I noticed that the festival's schedule shows significant overlap between the two main stages during peak evening hours. As someone who particularly loves both contemporary jazz fusion and Latin jazz, it's disappointing that I'll have to choose between performances running simultaneously at 8-9:30 PM. Any chance this could be adjusted? This has been my go-to festival for the past 3 years, and the scheduling has never been an issue before."
50,1629,2025-05-10 20:10:48.000,"I'm particularly gutted about missing DJ ThunderCloud's set - been following their drum and bass works since their underground days in 2019. Was really looking forward to hearing ""Midnight Storm"" live! "
11,1538,2025-05-03 10:48:05.000,"I've been attending events at your venue for the past year, and while I generally love the indie folk atmosphere and intimate setting, I'm writing to express my frustration with the recent changes to your ticketing system. Last night, I tried to transfer my tickets for next week's acoustic showcase to my sister (purchased for $85 each), but kept getting an error message saying ""Transfer failed - try again later"" (screenshot attached)."
132,1046,2025-03-25 23:43:26.000,"Secondly, while I appreciate the increased frequency of metal shows lately (as a huge metal fan myself!), I've noticed fewer world music events in the calendar. The last Persian classical music event was nearly 8 months ago! Could you please consider balancing the schedule a bit more?"
138,1571,2025-05-05 23:52:28.000,"I'd really appreciate your help with the ticket transfer issue as soon as possible, as the festival is only two weeks away. If the transfer isn't possible, I'd like to know my refund options."
63,1596,2025-05-08 01:59:12.000,"I'm having the worst experience trying to transfer my VIP tickets for next month's electronic music festival on the 15th. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep getting whenever I try to transfer the tickets to my sister's account. It just keeps saying ""Transfer failed - recipient not eligible"" even though she definitely has a validated account."
11,1734,2025-05-20 22:14:46.000,"Could you please:
1. Help me transfer these tickets promptly
2. Explain why the jazz nights have been reduced
3. Consider offering partial refunds for annual members affected by the programming changes"
87,89,2025-01-08 07:52:59.000,"I've been trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming ""Neon Dreams Festival"" to my sister since I unfortunately can't make it due to a family emergency. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep getting when attempting the transfer through your mobile app. It's super frustrating because I've already tried logging out and back in three times!"
52,664,2025-02-23 15:17:16.000,"The mobile app is quite buggy too - it crashes whenever I try to view my ticket barcode. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but no luck. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I'm getting."
162,855,2025-03-10 22:29:31.000,"Also, while I have your attention - I noticed you've been hosting fewer techno events lately. The warehouse parties you used to organize every second Saturday were absolute fire! Any chance those might make a comeback? The underground scene here really misses those events."
109,639,2025-02-22 03:04:23.000,"I'd really appreciate if you could help sort out this transfer issue ASAP, or at least confirm that my tickets are secure. You can reach me at this email or at (555) 123-4567."
118,1448,2025-04-26 12:40:14.000,"I've been a loyal customer and have attended this festival for the past 3 years - absolutely love the indie rock lineup you usually put together! This year's headliner would have been amazing to see, and I'm gutted that I have to miss it. While I'm here, I also wanted to mention that it would be great if you could consider adding more metal bands to your future lineups. The underground metal scene is really thriving right now!"
140,1299,2025-04-14 18:52:15.000,"Really hoping you can help sort out these issues, particularly the missing confirmation for the festival tickets, as I'm trying to coordinate travel plans with friends."
50,895,2025-03-14 05:53:45.000,"I've been a regular attendee of your indie folk events for 3 years, especially loving the acoustic sessions you host monthly. While I'm gutted to miss this one (the lineup looked amazing!), I'd really appreciate your help with this transfer. The festival is in 5 days, and I want to make sure my sister can get in without any issues."
50,684,2025-02-25 01:22:45.000,"On a side note, I noticed you've reduced the frequency of jazz nights from weekly to monthly. As someone who particularly enjoys bebop and contemporary jazz fusion, I'd love to see these return to a weekly schedule. The intimate venue setting really suits these performances!"
157,482,2025-02-09 03:46:40.000,"While I have you, I also wanted to mention that I absolutely love the new jazz series you've been hosting at The Blue Room. As a huge bebop enthusiast, it's refreshing to see more underground jazz artists getting spotlight. However, I noticed these shows are only scheduled monthly - any chance of increasing the frequency to bi-weekly? The last three shows were completely sold out, so I'm sure there's enough demand!"
89,902,2025-03-15 00:09:12.000,"The main problem is that even though I can access my account and see my tickets, the transfer button is complely grayed out. I've tried using different browsers (Chrome and Safari) and even attempted it on my phone, but no luck. This is particularly stressful because my sister is flying in from Toronto specifically for this event."
129,114,2025-01-10 06:40:14.000,"Lastly, kudos to your team for the new mobile app interface - it's much more user-friendly now, though the search filters could use some work when sorting by genre."
96,1632,2025-05-10 23:16:36.000,"While I've got your attention, I also wanted to mention that it would be amazing if you could bring back the monthly underground bass music events you used to host in 2022. Those intimate shows in the basement venue had such a special vibe!"
166,177,2025-01-15 17:46:35.000,"While I have you, I wanted to share some feedback about your new mobile app. The dark mode feature is fantastic, and I love how you've organized the electronic music categories into more specific subgenres. However, the payment processing seems slower than before, and twice last week, I was charged twice for the same ticket (though one charge was eventually reversed)."
70,826,2025-03-09 03:42:35.000,"On a positive note, I really appreciated how your security team handled the crowd management, and the free water stations were well-maintained throughout the event. I've been to many electronic music festivals across the country, but yours has potential to be among the top tier with some improvements to the ticketing system."
30,146,2025-01-12 23:47:28.000,"I purchased 2 VIP tickets ($189 each) under booking reference MF2023-45721. Given that the event is in 3 weeks, I'm getting quite anxious about this issue. I really need to transfer these tickets as I unfortunately can't attend anymore due to a family wedding."
5,67,2025-01-06 07:30:52.000,"The new mobile app is definitely an improvement from the old one, by the way! Much easier to navigate through different genres and filter by dates. Though it would be great if you could add a feature to save our favorite venues."
10,1348,2025-04-18 05:43:59.000,"While I have your attention, I'd also like to mention that I've noticed fewer acoustic shows lately. Being a huge fan of stripped-down performances, I'd love to see more of these intimate sessions. Your small stage upstairs is perfect for such events!"
17,1594,2025-05-07 23:54:14.000,"I've been trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming indie folk festival next month to my sister since I unfortunately can't make it anymore due to a work commitment. I've attempted the transfer three times through your app, but keep getting an error message saying ""Transfer failed - try again later"" (I've attached a screenshot of the error)."
128,1209,2025-04-08 12:04:39.000,"The recent price increase for VIP tickets is understandable given the current economy, but maybe you could consider introducing a loyalty program for regular attendees? Just a thought!"
17,43,2025-01-04 17:05:03.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention that I absolutely love the new venue you're using for the weekly jazz nights. The acoustics are incredible, and the intimate setting really enhances the experience. However, I've noticed that lately, these events have been reduced from weekly to bi-weekly. As a huge jazz enthusiast (especially bebop and contemporary fusion), I'd really love to see them return to a weekly schedule. The community that has built around these nights is really special."
83,1831,2025-05-28 02:33:08.000,"One more thing - is there any way to get a partial refund for the Classical Series subscription? I know it's clearly stated as non-refundable, but I'm moving overseas in September and will miss the last three concerts. I've been a premium member since day one, if that helps at all..."
125,558,2025-02-15 23:28:57.000,"I recently purchased 2 VIP tickets for the upcoming electronic music festival at Moonlight Gardens on July 15th, but I'm experiencing some issues. When I try to transfer one ticket to my friend Sarah through the app, I keep getting an error message saying ""Transfer failed - Error code 2305"" (screenshot attached). I've tried multiple times over the past 3 hours with no luck."
75,282,2025-01-24 12:57:40.000,"Secondly, I noticed that similar events are becoming less frequent in our area. As someone who's deeply into alternative and indie rock, I used to attend at least 2-3 festivals monthly at this venue last year. Now we're lucky if there's one every two months. The community really misses these gatherings!"
25,50,2025-01-05 04:37:24.000,"Despite these hiccups, I really appreciate what you're doing for the electronic music scene in our city. The sound system upgrades you did last month were fantastic - the low end is absolutely crushing now! "
19,1523,2025-05-02 14:59:16.000,"I tried calling your support line twice yesterday but was on hold for over 30 minutes each time before giving up. The festival is only two weeks away, and I need to get this sorted ASAP."
25,235,2025-01-19 21:20:45.000,I've been trying to get a hold of someone regarding my tickets to the upcoming Winter Symphony performance on December 15th. There seems to be an issue with the ticket transfer I initiated last week. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep getting whenever I try to send the tickets to my sister's account.
35,1508,2025-05-01 15:24:58.000,"Would appreciate your help with the ticket transfer, and please do consider more electronic music events!"
158,344,2025-01-29 05:07:15.000,"On a personal note, as someone who particularly enjoys bebop and hard bop, I'd love to see more of these genres featured in your lineup. The current focus on contemporary jazz is great, but some variety would be wonderful."
82,268,2025-01-23 13:59:44.000,"I've been trying to get this sorted out for days and I'm getting quite frustrated. I purchased 4 VIP tickets for the upcoming Summer Groove Festival on July 15th for my family, but the payment went through twice (I've attached a screenshot of both charges from my bank statement). While I appreciate the quick confirmation email for the first payment, I need the second charge of $899.50 refunded ASAP."
140,767,2025-03-05 01:31:27.000,"Lastly, I absolutely love the new feature showing venue seat views before purchase, but could you consider adding more viewing angles? Sometimes it's hard to judge the stage visibility from just one perspective, especially for the balcony sections."
158,599,2025-02-18 20:03:57.000,"I attended last Friday's jazz fusion concert at Moonlight Hall and wanted to share some feedback. While the acoustics were incredible and the musicians were top-notch, I noticed the event schedule on your website still shows monthly performances, but it seems you've switched to bi-weekly shows without updating this information. This caused some confusion among my friends who were planning to attend future events."
19,1267,2025-04-12 09:17:39.000,"I've been trying to transfer my VIP tickets for next week's jazz festival to my sister since I unexpectedly need to travel for work. I've attempted the transfer three times through your mobile app, but keep getting an error message saying ""Transfer failed - try again later"" (screenshot attached). The tickets were quite expensive ($289 each), and I really need to get this sorted soon."
166,546,2025-02-14 20:24:40.000,"While I have you, I also wanted to mention that I really love what you've been doing with the new monthly jazz nights - especially that fusion series! Though I wish they weren't always on Thursdays as it's hard for some of us working folks to make it. Any chance of alternating between weekday and weekend dates?"
128,77,2025-01-07 04:52:00.000,"On a positive note, I absolutely love that you're bringing more trance artists to the monthly Underground Sessions! The intimate venue setting really suits the genre. Any chance you could increase the frequency of these events? Once a month feels too long to wait!"
143,289,2025-01-24 22:58:22.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that I absolutely love how you've been increasing the frequency of world music performances lately! The fusion of traditional instruments with modern electronic elements in last week's show was mind-blowing. However, I noticed the sound quality in the upper balcony wasn't quite up to par - there was some feedback during the quieter passages."
126,137,2025-01-12 06:08:32.000,The new mobile app is much better than the old one - kudos to your tech team!
95,950,2025-03-18 12:12:27.000,"While I have you, I also wanted to mention that I'm loving the increased frequency of world music events lately - especially the monthly Latin jazz series! However, I noticed that the electronic/ambient shows have become less frequent. As someone who enjoys both traditional and experimental genres, it would be great to see a more balanced calendar."
118,1106,2025-03-30 02:46:50.000,"On a positive note, I absolutely loved the new visual installations you've added to the main room. The synchronization with the bass drops was phenomenal! Would love to see more ambient rooms in future events - maybe something with downtempo or atmospheric drum & bass?"
114,553,2025-02-15 07:31:30.000,"I've been trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming EDM festival at Riverside Park to my sister since I caught the flu and won't be able to attend.

65,1310,2025-04-15 16:04:58.000,"I attended the electronic music festival at Moonlight Gardens last weekend and wanted to share some thoughts. While DJ Starweaver's set was incredible (that bass drop at 1 AM was insane!), I noticed several issues with the venue's sound system during the early acts. There was noticeable distortion coming from the left speaker stack during the first two performances."
23,1151,2025-04-03 11:14:11.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention that I absolutely love the new jazz fusion artists you've been booking lately! The intimate venue setup for these shows is perfect, though I wish you'd host more of them during weekdays - the weekend shows always sell out so fast. The acoustic treatment in the Blue Room is fantastic for these performances."

147,88,2025-01-08 06:32:12.000,"There was also a small issue with the sound system during last week's performance - there was some feedback during the quieter passages that really affected the experience, especially during the piano solos."

67,175,2025-01-15 17:10:39.000,"Could you please help me sort this out? I paid $389 for the ticket (Order #NT78234), and I can provide any additional verification you need. If a transfer isn't possible for some reason, I'd like to know what my options are regarding a refund."

I tried to send my spare ticket to my friend through the app, but it kept showing an error message (screenshot attached). The error appeared right after I clicked ""transfer"" and entered her email. I had to meet her at the entrance and scan both tickets myself, which was really inconvenient since we arrived at different times."
136,387,2025-02-01 13:53:41.000,"One last thing - the new mobile app is quite buggy. When trying to access my ticket wallet, it crashes about 50% of the time (iPhone 14 Pro, latest iOS). I can send video evidence if needed."

23,1312,2025-04-15 18:30:58.000,"Also, while I have your attention, I wanted to mention that I'd love to see more frequent jazz events in your smaller venue.

First, I've been trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming electronic dance festival ""Neon Dreams 2024"" to my sister's account since she'll be attending in my place, but I keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). The error appears right after I enter her email and click ""confirm transfer."""
52,1123,2025-04-01 01:08:08.000,"Since you advertise monthly electronic music events, I was wondering if you could also consider adding more metal bands to your lineup? The metal community here is pretty active, and I think there's definitely a market for it."
104,1573,2025-05-06 12:52:55.000,"Additionally, I noticed that these jazz events seem to be becoming less frequent - we used to have similar shows every two weeks, but now it's maybe once a month. As someone who particularly enjoys experimental jazz and fusion genres, I'd love to see more of these events return to the regular schedule."
101,261,2025-01-22 16:05:22.000,"On a positive note, I really appreciate the new mobile check-in feature you've implemented. It made entering the contemporary folk concert last week so much smoother."
146,1165,2025-04-04 15:50:13.000,"Additionally, I wanted to share some feedback about event notifications. As someone who's really into indie folk and acoustic performances, I noticed I'm getting a lot of EDM show alerts despite updating my preferences. While I appreciate staying informed, it would be great if the recommendations could better align with my musical interests."
157,1493,2025-04-29 18:12:36.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that I've noticed fewer trance events being scheduled lately. Any chance you could pass along feedback to the programming team? The underground trance scene here is pretty active, and I think there'd be good demand for more shows in that genre."

133,573,2025-02-16 17:08:57.000,"On a positive note, the new contactless payment system for merchandise was a huge improvement from previous events.

101,1709,2025-05-18 06:18:59.000,"Also, I noticed the ticket prices for the summer series have increased quite significantly. While I understand costs go up, a 40% jump seems quite steep.

28,1645,2025-05-12 10:38:22.000,"While I have your attention, I wanted to mention that I really miss the monthly jazz nights you used to host. As someone who practically lived for those intimate Thursday sessions, the current quarterly schedule just isn't enough. The ambient electronic events are cool and all, but there was something special about those weekly jazz performances."
149,750,2025-03-03 11:06:15.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that I've been a regular attendee of your classical music events for the past three years, and I've noticed fewer chamber music performances lately. The recent focus seems to be more on large orchestral works, which are wonderful, but I particularly enjoy the intimacy of smaller ensemble performances. Any chance we might see more string quartet events in the upcoming season?"

111,378,2025-01-31 19:48:54.000,"Also, while I have your attention - any chance you'll be bringing back the winter indoor series? Those intimate shows at The Crystal Room last year were absolute fire, especially that experimental jazz fusion night!"

First off, the electronic payment for my VIP pass to the upcoming Summer Beat Festival keeps getting declined, even though I've triple-checked that all my card details are correct. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep receiving."
149,1131,2025-04-01 17:49:59.000,"I'm a huge fan of drum & bass and have been following your events for years - I've attended 6 of your festivals in the past 3 years! I particularly appreciate how you've been bringing underground artists to the spotlight. However, this experience left a bitter taste, especially considering the premium we paid for VIP access."
92,941,2025-03-17 16:53:37.000,"I've been a regular attendee at your venue for the past few months, and while I generally love the atmosphere and lineup of electronic/techno artists, I'm experiencing some frustration with your new ticketing system. I attempted to transfer my tickets for next Friday's underground bass music event to my friend (since I unfortunately have to work late), but the transfer button keeps showing an error. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I'm getting."
52,1818,2025-05-26 19:10:13.000,"I attended your electronic music festival last weekend, and while the production value was incredible (those laser shows were mind-blowing!), I'm writing about two issues I encountered."
137,958,2025-03-18 22:57:50.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that the new venue layout was much better than last year's - having the electronic stage further from the folk stage really helped with sound bleeding. However, the drink lines were incredibly long, and the VIP area wasn't worth the extra cost since the viewing platform was blocked by speaker towers."
6,679,2025-02-24 17:01:29.000,"I've been having an incredibly frustrating experience with my ticket transfer for the upcoming Electronic Paradise Festival. I tried transferring my VIP pass to my sister's account three times now, but keep getting an error message saying ""Transfer failed - recipient not found"" (screenshot attached).

69,1022,2025-03-24 07:09:55.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention that I really appreciate how you've been bringing more alternative and psychedelic rock acts to the venue lately. The underground music scene here has been pretty quiet, and it's refreshing to see some variety. However, I noticed that most shows are scheduled on Thursdays, which is tough for those of us working early mornings. Any chance of moving some of these to Fridays or Saturdays?"
86,1679,2025-05-15 13:57:00.000,"Also, I'm having trouble transferring my tickets for the upcoming ""Electronic Dreams"" event to my sister.

I've tried using the transfer function in your app multiple times, but keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). Could you please help me with this? I really don't want these tickets to go to waste - my sister is a huge electronic music fan and has been dying to see some of these DJs."
105,979,2025-03-20 04:34:29.000,"I know this is a bit of a two-part email, but I'd really appreciate help with both issues. The ticket transfer is obviously more urgent since the event is in three weeks."

29,931,2025-03-17 03:30:42.000,"Also, small suggestion - it would be great if the water stations near the main stage could be more clearly marked. We spent almost 20 minutes trying to find one during peak hours."
122,169,2025-01-15 03:09:13.000,"This is particularly frustrating because I've been looking forward to this festival for months - especially to see the acoustic sets in the intimate woodland stage. My sister and I are huge fans of the folk-bluegrass fusion scene, and this would be our first festival together since before the pandemic."
103,1517,2025-05-01 22:45:17.000,"I've been trying to transfer my VIP tickets for the upcoming Midnight Symphony concert to my sister since I can't make it anymore (caught COVID, unfortunately).

I've attached a screenshot of the error for reference."
97,813,2025-03-08 07:44:01.000,"Also, quick question - are you planning to keep the bi-monthly frequency for the warehouse events? The current schedule works perfectly with my work roster, and the intimate vibe of these smaller shows is something special."
80,1730,2025-05-20 20:08:35.000,"Additionally, I'd love to provide some feedback about the festival frequency in the Pacific Northwest. As someone who travels from Portland for your events, it would be amazing if you could consider hosting more shows during the winter months. The scene here is growing rapidly, and there's definitely demand for more underground electronic music events, especially in the experimental/ambient space."
68,1374,2025-04-20 03:38:32.000,"One last thing - the new mobile app is quite buggy when trying to access the digital tickets. Sometimes it takes up to 5 minutes to load, which caused me to miss the opening act last week. Not fun when you're standing in line in the rain!"
46,248,2025-01-21 07:25:00.000,"This is incredibly frustrating as I'm a regular attendee of your events - I've been to at least 6 techno and house music shows you've organized this year alone! The lineup for this festival is insane, and I particularly can't wait to see those new underground DJs from Berlin you're bringing in."
61,1590,2025-05-07 14:27:10.000,"While I have your attention, I'd love to suggest having more world music events in your lineup. As someone who's really into Balkan brass bands and Latin jazz, I notice these genres are underrepresented in your programming. The quarterly world music showcase you used to host in 2021 was fantastic - any chance of bringing something similar back?"
163,1150,2025-04-03 02:55:02.000,"Additionally, I'm having issues with my ticket transfer for next month's jazz fusion showcase.

I was originally supposed to attend with my boyfriend, but we had to leave early on Day 2 due to a family emergency."
127,524,2025-02-13 05:48:49.000,"While I have your attention, I also wanted to mention that I've noticed fewer electronic dance events in the Downtown venue lately. As someone who's been a regular attendee for the past 3 years, particularly for trance and progressive house shows, it's been disappointing to see this change. The acoustics in that venue are perfect for electronic music, especially with that new sound system you installed last summer."
148,1477,2025-04-28 03:03:20.000,"Also, just a small suggestion - it would be amazing if you could add a genre filter to your event calendar. Sometimes it's hard to find specific types of events when browsing through everything."
101,711,2025-02-27 14:29:58.000,"I'm really frustrated with my recent experience trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming jazz festival next month.

10,1638,2025-05-11 13:06:35.000,"I know you probably get tons of these emails, but any help with the ticket transfer would be greatly appreciated. I'd rather not have these tickets go to waste - they weren't cheap! Plus, my sister is a huge fan of both headliners."
151,500,2025-02-10 23:26:05.000,I'm also having an issue with my ticket transfer for next week's jazz fusion concert. I purchased 2 tickets (Order #MT789321) but need to transfer one to my sister. I've tried using the transfer function in your app but keep getting an error message. I've attached a screenshot of the error for reference.
103,544,2025-02-14 13:04:12.000,"I'm also having an issue with my tickets for next week's jazz quartet performance.

19,285,2025-01-24 18:16:01.000,"While I have your attention - I've been to three of your events this year and love the venues you choose, but I noticed you're hosting fewer jazz events lately. The acoustic setup at The Blue Room was perfect for jazz, and I miss those intimate Thursday night sessions. Any chance those might return?"
115,1417,2025-04-24 06:11:37.000,"Also, I'm a bit frustrated about the frequency of metal shows in your venue. As someone who loves thrash and death metal, I feel like we're getting maybe one show every three months, while pop concerts happen almost weekly. Any chance you could book more metal acts?"
107,119,2025-01-10 23:02:41.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that I really love how you've been bringing more world music artists to the venue lately. The traditional percussion showcase last month was incredible! However, I wish you would host more electronic music events - maybe some ambient or experimental stuff? The acoustics in your space would be perfect for it."
12,1138,2025-04-01 23:46:33.000,"I absolutely love electronic music and have been to your venues multiple times - the Underground Bass series last year was phenomenal! That's why I'm particularly disappointed about missing this one. I've noticed you're hosting fewer trance events lately, which is my favorite genre. Any chance you could bring back those monthly trance nights?"
43,818,2025-03-08 17:53:39.000,"Also, I've been trying to transfer my VIP tickets for next month's Summer Beats concert to my sister since I'll be out of town, but I keep getting an error message on the app (screenshot attached).

I tried following the instructions to send them to my sister (her email is claire.smith@email.com), but I keep getting an error message saying ""transfer failed - error code 2445"" (screenshot attached). This is super frustrating as I've already had to miss three electronic music events this year due to work, and I really wanted my sister to experience this one since she's a huge classical music fan."
2,1018,2025-03-24 01:35:17.000,"Also, I noticed that the winter concert series schedule hasn't been updated since last month. Will you be adding more electronic music shows? The techno events tend to sell out quickly, and I'd love to plan ahead."

14,1830,2025-05-28 01:51:18.000,I'd appreciate a refund for the unused Saturday ticket (Order #TR789456) or at least credit toward a future event. I've been a loyal customer for three years and have attended over 20 shows through your platform.
57,75,2025-01-07 00:50:29.000,"I'm a huge techno fan and have been to every summer festival you've organized since 2019, so I know transfers are usually allowed. Is there perhaps a technical issue with the system? I'd really appreciate if you could help me transfer these tickets to my other friends or process a refund for the two unused passes. "
7,159,2025-01-14 04:52:58.000,"One last thing - any chance you could add some progressive rock shows to your roster? The local prog rock scene is really underserved, and I know quite a few people who would love to see more of that genre represented."
51,1243,2025-04-10 21:53:01.000,"I've been a loyal attendee of your events for the past 3 years (especially love your underground techno nights!), and this is the first time I've encountered such an issue. The ticket wasn't cheap - $189, and I'd really hate to see it go to waste."
82,1349,2025-04-18 07:23:07.000,"Also, while I'm writing - I've been a loyal attendee of your jazz events for the past 3 years, and I've noticed you've really cut back on the bebop performances lately. The contemporary fusion stuff is fine, but some of us old-school jazz lovers would love to see more traditional acts. The last truly great bebop show you hosted was back in February, and I'd hate to have to start looking elsewhere for my jazz fix."
130,1656,2025-05-13 08:25:49.000,This event has been on my calendar since you announced that amazing techno DJ duo as headliners - they're absolutely my favorite in the underground scene right now. I'd really appreciate if someone could look into this ASAP as I know VIP tickets are selling fast.
81,1229,2025-04-09 20:40:03.000,"This is really frustrating because I paid $175 for these premium seats, and I don't want them to go to waste. I absolutely love this venue - I've seen some amazing neo-soul and contemporary jazz shows here, and your acoustics are always perfect for those intimate performances. However, I'm a bit disappointed with the ticketing system lately. "

64,1575,2025-05-06 14:56:43.000,"I attended last Friday's jazz fusion concert at your venue and wanted to share my experience. While the musicianship was exceptional (especially that mind-blowing saxophone solo in the second set!), I noticed the sound system had significant distortion during the louder passages. I've attached a video clip showing the issue during one particular moment."
117,695,2025-02-26 02:39:03.000,While I'm writing this - huge props to your sound engineer! The acoustics at last week's world music festival were phenomenal. That percussion section came through crystal clear even from the back of the venue.

110,1648,2025-05-12 17:58:41.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that I absolutely love what you've been doing with the underground techno events lately! The warehouse series has been incredible - though I wish they weren't all on Thursdays. Some of us have early Friday meetings! 😅"
154,1254,2025-04-11 12:22:59.000,"Also, quick heads up - the calendar feature on your website seems to be showing incorrect times for next month's events. Everything appears to be 2 hours off compared to what's shown on your Instagram posts."
126,914,2025-03-15 23:52:50.000,I'd appreciate a response within 48 hours as the festival is next weekend.
123,1212,2025-04-08 15:04:58.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention how disappointed I am with the decreasing frequency of jazz events lately. As someone who's been attending your venue's jazz nights for over 3 years, I've noticed we've gone from weekly shows to just monthly. The quality is still fantastic - the acoustic trio last month was mind-blowing - but I really miss having more regular jazz evenings. The jazz community here is bigger than you might think!"
14,1470,2025-04-27 22:02:56.000,"I'm also writing because I'm having trouble transferring my tickets for the upcoming Underground Bass series. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep getting when trying to send the tickets to my sister. It just says ""Transfer failed - Error code 2445"" but doesn't explain why.

114,1678,2025-05-15 09:59:42.000,"Also, while I have your attention - I noticed you've reduced the frequency of jazz nights at The Blue Room venue from weekly to monthly. Any chance you could bring back the weekly schedule? Those intimate jazz sessions were perfect for unwinding after work, and the local jazz community really misses the regular meetups."
130,1853,2025-05-29 19:46:23.000,"Secondly, the event page initially advertised early entry for VIP ticket holders starting at 2 PM, but when we arrived, security told us entry wouldn't begin until 3:30 PM. We waited in the hot sun for nothing! As someone who particularly wanted to catch the opening folk-fusion acts, this was really disappointing."
110,1092,2025-03-29 12:24:57.000,"Also, there seems to be an issue with the drink tokens I pre-purchased for last month's show - they're still showing as ""pending"" in my account. I have the payment confirmation from my bank (screenshot attached)."
134,123,2025-01-11 04:45:00.000,"I've attached the error message screenshot and would really appreciate your help with the ticket transfer issue. It's for the July 15th event, booking reference #JF2023-876543."
66,654,2025-02-22 23:10:25.000,"I'd greatly appreciate your help with the ticket transfer issue as my friends need to arrange their travel plans. Also, any insights about the jazz programming would be wonderful."
129,1356,2025-04-18 22:17:31.000,"This is really stressing me out because I just found out I have to travel for work that weekend, and my sister is a huge fan of neo-classical fusion.

153,334,2025-01-28 13:03:20.000,"Also, I noticed the frequency of weekend events has decreased significantly since September. Are you planning to bring back more Saturday night shows? The 7 PM time slots were perfect for those of us who like to enjoy a full concert experience but still need to get up early for work the next day."
163,605,2025-02-19 04:58:15.000,"I attended last week's jazz fusion concert at The Blue Note and wanted to share some thoughts. While the music was exceptional, especially that mind-blowing saxophone solo in the second set, I noticed the venue seemed to be oversold. I had VIP tickets (Order #VIP-2023-8867), but found myself struggling to reach the designated VIP area due to overcrowding."
95,620,2025-02-20 10:56:05.000,"I've been trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming indie-folk festival next month, but I keep getting an error message when attempting to send them to my sister's account (screenshot attached).

I've only made this one transfer attempt, so I don't understand why this is happening."
12,127,2025-01-11 15:15:24.000,I'd really appreciate your help with the ticket transfer issue as soon as possible since the event is coming up soon.

35,102,2025-01-09 05:43:41.000,"Just wanted to drop a quick note about my experience at last week's underground techno event at The Blue Room. While DJ Eclipse's set was absolutely mind-blowing (those deep house transitions were something else!), I noticed the event calendar shows nothing similar coming up for the next two months.

43,1172,2025-04-05 10:50:48.000,"One last thing - I love how you're bringing more international artists to our city, but I noticed most shows are scheduled on Saturdays. Any chance we could see some Friday night events? It would make it easier for those of us who travel from neighboring cities."
111,960,2025-03-19 01:15:02.000,"I've been trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming EDM festival on July 15th to my friend Sarah, but I keep getting an error message on the app (screenshot attached).

29,1391,2025-04-21 14:13:21.000,"On a more positive note, I absolutely loved the underground techno stage! As someone who's been following the techno scene for over a decade, the sound system quality was exceptional. Have you considered hosting more frequent techno-focused events? The quarterly schedule seems a bit sparse given the growing electronic music community in our area."
143,613,2025-02-20 03:42:10.000,I've been a loyal member for 3 years and have attended nearly every neo-soul and jazz fusion event you've hosted. Really appreciate your help with this!

93,1163,2025-04-04 14:03:22.000,One suggestion - the waiting time between acts seemed unnecessarily long (40+ minutes). Perhaps you could consider having smaller acts perform on a secondary stage during these transitions?
79,1825,2025-05-27 23:21:11.000,"Also, while I have your attention, I've noticed that there haven't been many jazz fusion events lately in the downtown venue.

144,1067,2025-03-27 17:15:37.000,"One suggestion - it would be amazing if you could host more drum & bass events! The local scene is really lacking in that department, and your venue would be perfect for it. I know several friends who would definitely become regular attendees."

The fusion performances have been incredible! However, I noticed that the electronic music events have become less frequent - we used to get at least two EDM shows per month, and now it's down to maybe one every couple of months.

78,1693,2025-05-16 16:18:11.000,"I attended last weekend's jazz fusion concert at the Harmony Hall, and while the acoustics were amazing, I noticed a concerning trend. The venue is hosting fewer and fewer jazz events compared to last year - we used to get 2-3 quality jazz shows per month, but now we're down to maybe one every couple of months. As a long-time jazz enthusiast who particularly enjoys bebop and contemporary fusion, this is quite disappointing."
91,1813,2025-05-26 12:35:37.000,"Also, I purchased tickets for the Summer Electronica Festival next month (Order #EF-2023-8867), but realized I double-booked that weekend. What's your refund policy? If a refund isn't possible, I'd be happy to list them on your official resale platform."
140,41,2025-01-04 15:19:46.000,"Please help me sort out this ticket transfer issue ASAP, as the concert is next week. My confirmation number is BTX-889321."
139,583,2025-02-17 09:14:01.000,I really hope you can help with the ticket transfer issue ASAP as the festival is in 9 days. The tickets weren't cheap and I'd hate for them to go to waste.
161,1460,2025-04-27 11:50:17.000,One suggestion though - it would be amazing if you could add more underground hip-hop acts to your lineup. I know several local artists who would be perfect for your Wednesday night showcase events.
134,1389,2025-04-21 11:11:12.000,"I've been having issues with transferring my tickets for next month's jazz fusion concert at The Blue Room. I purchased 3 tickets last week under my account (order #RT789321), but I need to transfer 2 of them to my friends since they'll be arriving separately. I've tried using the transfer function on your mobile app several times, but it keeps showing an error message (screenshot attached). The error appears right after I enter my friend's email address."
21,1532,2025-05-03 00:40:16.000,"I really don't want these tickets to go to waste - I've been following this indie folk band since their early days and was so excited when they announced this acoustic session. My sister's an even bigger folk music fan than I am, and she's dying to go."
88,743,2025-03-02 20:18:35.000,"I'm having a really frustrating experience with my recent ticket purchase for the upcoming Summer Jazz Fusion Festival. I bought 4 VIP tickets last Thursday (order #RT789321), but I've been charged twice for the same order! I've attached a screenshot of both transactions from my bank statement."
79,944,2025-03-18 01:32:22.000,Could you please help me with the ticket transfer problem? I need to get this sorted within the next week as my friends are finalizing their travel plans.
155,1528,2025-05-02 19:22:53.000,"I hope this finds you well. I recently attended the midnight electronic music festival at Harmony Gardens last weekend, and while the overall experience was incredible (especially DJ StarPulse's set - I'm a huge fan of deep house), I encountered a concerning issue with my VIP ticket transfer."
139,1112,2025-03-31 00:40:15.000,"Also, while I have your attention - I noticed you've reduced the frequency of jazz events in the Blue Room venue. As someone who's been attending the weekly jazz nights for the past year, it's disappointing to see them become monthly instead. The intimate setting and acoustic performances were perfect for discovering new artists in the local jazz scene."
109,1263,2025-04-12 01:53:48.000,"On a positive note, I love that you've increased the frequency of your drum & bass nights to twice a month! The lighting setup for these events is absolutely incredible. Would it be possible to consider adding some ambient/experimental electronic events to your calendar? The scene for this genre is growing in our area."
77,1767,2025-05-22 21:09:00.000,"One small suggestion: it would be great if you could add some world music events to your lineup. I've been really getting into Afrobeat lately, and I know there's a growing scene for it in our area."
65,1096,2025-03-29 18:26:47.000,"I've been a loyal customer of your platform for years, mostly attending electronic and techno events. Last weekend's experience at Warehouse 42 left me quite frustrated though. I purchased 4 VIP tickets for my friends and myself (Order #8742196) for the Spring Bass Festival, but when we arrived, the QR codes wouldn't scan properly. I've attached a screenshot of the error message we received."
90,1722,2025-05-19 12:19:21.000,"I've been a regular attendee of your electronic music events for the past three years, especially loving your underground techno nights. While your customer service has always been excellent, I'm a bit frustrated that this seemingly simple transfer is causing so much trouble. I'm particularly anxious because this is a sold-out event, and my sister is flying in specifically for this."
129,108,2025-01-09 12:41:22.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that I really miss the monthly indie rock showcases you used to host at your downtown venue. The intimate setting was perfect for discovering new local bands, and the acoustic performances were always top-notch. Any chance these might return? The current bi-monthly electronic music nights are great (I'm particularly into ambient techno), but some variety would be awesome."
141,883,2025-03-13 03:30:12.000,"Additionally, I tried to transfer one of my Day 2 tickets to my brother, but the transfer feature keeps timing out. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep getting - it's the one with the red exclamation mark that appears after I enter his email address."
163,92,2025-01-08 14:10:16.000,"While I have you, I just wanted to say that the new QR code system you implemented last month is fantastic - so much smoother than the old paper tickets! However, the drink token feature in the app is still quite buggy."
126,349,2025-01-29 17:18:37.000,"I'm really frustrated with my recent experience on your platform. I've been trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming Midnight Harmonies Festival to my sister since I can't make it due to a family emergency.

160,1568,2025-05-05 17:16:21.000,Could you please help me sort out this ticket transfer issue? My sister needs to make travel arrangements soon.
61,1805,2025-05-26 01:00:32.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that I love how you've been including more world music artists in your lineups lately. The fusion of traditional instruments with modern electronic elements has been incredible! However, I do wish you would host more weekday evening shows - the weekend events are always so packed, and parking becomes a nightmare."
143,1160,2025-04-04 11:38:14.000,"While I have your attention, I also wanted to mention that I absolutely love what you've been doing with the underground techno scene lately. The warehouse events have such an authentic vibe! However, I noticed that you've reduced the frequency of drum and bass nights from weekly to monthly. As someone who's been attending these events for over 3 years, I really miss the weekly schedule. The community that was built around those weekly events was something special."
75,172,2025-01-15 11:15:10.000,"On a related note, I'm trying to transfer my tickets for next month's electronic music showcase to my sister since I'll be out of town. I've attempted the transfer through the app multiple times but keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). The tickets were $75 each, and I have two of them."
134,1198,2025-04-07 13:55:40.000,"I'm a huge techno fan and have been attending your events for the past three years, so I'm pretty familiar with your ticketing system, but this issue is new to me. The festival lineup looks amazing this year, especially the underground warehouse stage, and I'd hate for these tickets to go to waste."
18,470,2025-02-08 09:15:06.000,"On a positive note, I absolutely loved the new mobile app update - being able to see the real-time schedule updates is fantastic. However, I did spot a small bug where the reminder notifications aren't coming through for favorited artists (screenshot of this issue also attached)."
97,1454,2025-04-26 20:14:45.000,"While I've got your attention, I also  wanted to mention that I love what you're doing with the new underground electronic music series. The monthly frequency is perfect, and as someone who's really into experimental techno and ambient, it's refreshing to see these genres getting proper representation. However, the sound system at The Blue Room venue could use some improvement, especially for the bass-heavy sets."
92,1255,2025-04-11 12:38:25.000,"Also, while I have your attention - any chance you might consider hosting more baroque music events? I noticed the programming has been heavily focused on romantic era pieces lately. Don't get me wrong, they're beautiful, but some Bach or Vivaldi would be a wonderful addition to the lineup!"
45,1467,2025-04-27 16:04:21.000,"I've been trying to transfer my VIP ticket for the upcoming electronic music festival at Sunset Valley to my sister since I unfortunately have a work commitment that weekend.

15,1054,2025-03-26 13:37:13.000,"On a positive note, your new mobile app interface is much more user-friendly! However, when trying to transfer tickets to friends, it still takes way too many clicks to complete the process. Perhaps this could be streamlined?"
135,1842,2025-05-28 17:24:48.000,"On a positive note, the new seating arrangement in Section C provides much better viewing angles, and the sound quality has significantly improved since your recent system upgrade. The bass was crystal clear - perfect for those deep double bass solos!"
15,890,2025-03-13 19:53:52.000,"I attended the Summer Vibes Festival last weekend and need help with a few things. First, my friend and I noticed that our tickets were double-charged (Order #VF-29847 and #VF-29848). I've attached a screenshot of my bank statement showing both charges."
103,967,2025-03-19 04:42:23.000,"However, I do find it frustrating that the early bird tickets sell out within seconds. Perhaps implementing a queue system like other venues would make it fairer for regular attendees like myself?"

124,1505,2025-05-01 13:05:22.000,"On a positive note, the new ventilation system at the venue is a massive improvement! However, the drink prices have become rather steep - $15 for a bottle of water seems excessive, especially during a 6-hour event."
99,291,2025-01-25 06:37:59.000,"I've been wanting to write to express my deep disappointment with the recent changes to your event scheduling. I'm a huge progressive metal fan and have been attending your venue's Metal Mondays for the past 2 years, but reducing it from weekly to monthly is really affecting the local metal community we've built. Several of us used to meet up every week, and it was the highlight of our Mondays."

1. Process a refund for one of the duplicate charges
2. Explain the reasoning behind the reduced show frequency

4,1756,2025-05-22 09:08:20.000,"One small suggestion - it would be great if you could add an e-wallet feature to your app. I had to get a refund for a cancelled show last month, and waiting 5-7 business days for the money to return to my credit card was a bit inconvenient."
61,1197,2025-04-07 08:52:20.000,"I've been having issues with transferring my ticket for the upcoming indie folk festival at Meadowview Gardens on July 15th.

I've attached a screenshot of the error page for reference. "
12,1583,2025-05-07 00:04:41.000,"On a separate note, I really appreciate that you've started incorporating more ambient/experimental sets before the main acts. That 30-minute drone performance last week was absolutely mesmerizing! Would love to see more of that genre mixed in."
43,1222,2025-04-09 11:14:10.000,"I wanted to share my experience from last night's electronic music festival at Sunset Arena. While the sound system and light effects were absolutely incredible during the midnight set, I noticed the bass was significantly lower during the opening acts.

128,603,2025-02-19 01:38:23.000,"One suggestion - it would be amazing if you could add a notification system for when our favorite genres are featured in upcoming events.

155,526,2025-02-13 08:20:56.000,"The new payment plan option you've introduced for festival tickets is fantastic, though! It made it so much easier for me to budget for the Summer Symphony Series (even though I now have to miss Neon Pulse 😅)."
77,317,2025-01-27 03:35:07.000,"While I have your attention, I also wanted to mention that the frequency of metal shows has dropped significantly in the past few months. As someone who especially enjoys progressive metal, I'd love to see more of these events scheduled, particularly during weekends. The mosh pit at your venue is one of the best in the city!"
150,1219,2025-04-09 07:52:30.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that I'm a bit disappointed with the recent change in the festival schedule. Having it every other month instead of monthly means I'm missing out on so much amazing techno and house music! The underground scene here really depends on these events. Last month's drum & bass night with that new DJ collective was absolutely incredible - exactly the kind of experimental stuff we need more of."
13,992,2025-03-21 06:47:59.000,"While I have your attention, I also wanted to mention that I really miss the monthly indie rock showcases you used to host at The Blue Room.

I've attached a screenshot of the error message for reference. I've tried using different browsers and even my phone, but no luck."
118,1754,2025-05-22 06:58:57.000,"I've tried logging out and back in, clearing my cache, and even using a different browser, but nothing seems to work. Could you please help me sort this out ASAP? My sister needs to make travel arrangements, and time is getting a bit tight."
119,2,2025-01-01 01:36:29.000,"While I have your attention, I'd also like to mention that I really appreciate how you've been bringing more jazz fusion acts to the venue lately. The quality of artists has been exceptional, though I personally would love to see more shows during weekdays. As someone who works in hospitality, weekend shows are often difficult for me to attend."
49,1623,2025-05-10 09:47:28.000,"I've been trying to transfer my VIP tickets for the upcoming Summer Groove Festival to my sister since I unfortunately can't make it due to a work commitment. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep getting when I try to use the transfer function on your website. It keeps saying ""Transfer unavailable for this ticket type"" even though I've seen others successfully transfer similar tickets on your Facebook group."

Every time I click the ""Transfer"" button, it just loads endlessly and then crashes. This is super frustrating as I need to give this ticket to my sister since I can't make it anymore due to a family wedding."
81,1432,2025-04-25 07:49:07.000,"I'd appreciate if you could:
1. Refund the duplicate charge ASAP
2. Confirm my original 4 VIP tickets are still valid
3. Let me know if there are plans for additional stages"
38,1016,2025-03-23 18:04:58.000,"Also, I'm wondering about the frequency of these events - the monthly schedule you had last summer with different EDM subgenres each week was perfect for us ravers. Any chance you'll bring that back? "
14,1720,2025-05-19 10:25:03.000,The new ventilation system is a massive improvement - kudos on that upgrade!
71,326,2025-01-27 18:01:17.000,"Also, while I have your attention - I noticed that similar electronic music festivals in our area seem to be scheduled very close together this summer. Last year they were more spread out, which made it easier for fans like me to attend multiple events. Any chance you could consider spacing them out more next year?"
63,578,2025-02-17 00:33:51.000,Please let me know about the ticket transfer issue when you can - my sister needs to make travel arrangements soon.
25,1381,2025-04-20 19:26:38.000,"Also, what's up with the frequency of your drum & bass nights? You used to host them every second Friday, but looking at your schedule, I only see two planned for the next three months. The DnB community here is massive, and we're desperate for more regular events!"
64,1225,2025-04-09 15:43:46.000,"I've been experiencing some frustrating issues with my ticket transfer for the upcoming electronic dance festival at Moonlight Arena. I've attempted to transfer my VIP pass to my sister three times now, but keep getting an error message saying ""Transfer Failed - Error Code 2468"" (screenshot attached). The festival is this weekend, and I really need this sorted ASAP."
112,604,2025-02-19 02:37:16.000,"I also wanted to mention that it would be great if you could host more metal shows at your venue. While I appreciate the variety of genres you bring in, the metal community here is pretty active, and we'd love to see more regular heavy music events, especially during the fall season."
142,297,2025-01-25 18:17:42.000,"On a separate note, I wanted to mention how much I've enjoyed the recent increase in blues performances at your venue. As someone who grew up listening to classic blues, it's refreshing to see emerging artists in this genre. However, I think the sound mixing during last week's performance could use some improvement - the bass was overpowering the vocals, especially during the second set."
110,1109,2025-03-30 13:40:43.000,"On a related note, I absolutely loved the jazz fusion elements in the second half of the show! As someone who's been following the contemporary jazz scene for years, it was refreshing to see such innovative arrangements. Any chance you'll be hosting more jazz events in the future? The quarterly frequency of your jazz series seems a bit sparse - would love to see more regular jazz programming, maybe monthly?"
37,1088,2025-03-29 07:06:37.000,"I'm a huge fan of techno and deep house, and I've been looking forward to seeing DJ MoonPhase's set - they rarely tour in this area! I've already booked my accommodation and arranged time off work, so I'm really hoping we can sort this out quickly."
83,875,2025-03-12 13:31:16.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention that I'm a bit disappointed with the recent shift in your event scheduling. As someone who's primarily into techno and deep house, I noticed you've reduced weekend underground events from twice monthly to just once. The mainstream pop concerts are great, but they're not really my scene. Any chance we could get more late-night electronic shows back on the calendar?"
82,1783,2025-05-23 16:17:10.000,Could you please help me sort out the ticket issue first? I need to make sure all of us can get in without any problems at the gate.
89,606,2025-02-19 05:09:46.000,This is pretty urgent since I just found out I'll be out of town that weekend for a work conference. These tickets weren't cheap - $175 each! - and I'd really hate to see them go to waste. My sister is a massive fan of industrial techno and has been dying to see the headliner.
126,1028,2025-03-24 17:05:05.000,"I've been trying to process a ticket transfer for the upcoming Electronic Garden Festival next month, but I keep encountering an error message (screenshot attached) when I click the ""Transfer"" button. I've already promised these tickets to my sister as her birthday gift, and I'm getting quite anxious as the event is only 3 weeks away."
101,1185,2025-04-06 12:39:58.000,"Quick question - will you be continuing the monthly underground warehouse events? Those intimate shows are perfect for discovering new artists, and the sound system at the last one I attended was incredible. Haven't seen any announcements for May yet."
106,208,2025-01-18 03:07:54.000,"I attended last weekend's indie folk festival at Riverbank Arena and wanted to share my experience. While the acoustics were fantastic and I particularly enjoyed the sunset performance on the Garden Stage, I encountered some issues with the mobile ticketing system. During entry, the QR code wouldn't load properly due to poor reception (screenshot attached), causing a 20-minute delay. Several other attendees faced similar problems."
17,151,2025-01-13 11:36:57.000,"One last thing - the event schedule shows performances starting at 2 PM, but your Instagram post from yesterday mentioned 3 PM. Could you confirm the correct start time?"
3,1053,2025-03-26 11:49:37.000,"This is quite frustrating as I've already tried three times, and I really need to transfer this ticket since I can't make it due to a family emergency. I paid $85 for the premium seating, and I'd hate to have it go to waste."
7,1410,2025-04-23 12:28:23.000,"I've been having issues with ticket transfers for the upcoming electronic dance festival at Meadowlands next month. I tried transferring 2 VIP tickets to my friend's account (username: danceQueen92) three times now, but keep getting an ""invalid recipient"" error. I've attached a screenshot of the error message for reference."
43,239,2025-01-20 04:25:13.000,"On a positive note, the new ventilation system is a massive improvement! Finally being able to enjoy a packed show without feeling like I'm in a sauna is fantastic. Also, whoever was in charge of booking that experimental jazz fusion act for the second stage deserves a raise - absolutely incredible!"
157,1200,2025-04-07 16:40:45.000,"One more thing - the new mobile app is definitely an improvement, but I've noticed that sometimes the seat selection map doesn't load properly on my Android phone. Not a huge deal, just thought you should know."

49,1624,2025-05-10 11:53:29.000,"However, I'm a bit disappointed with the recent price increase for the VIP packages. As someone who's been a loyal customer for three years (mostly for your jazz and world music events), I feel the 30% jump is quite steep, especially since the perks haven't changed."
92,331,2025-01-28 09:26:14.000,"On a positive note, I really appreciate how you've been handling the queue system for major events. The new numbered wristband approach for entry has made the experience much smoother compared to the old first-come-first-served system."
153,1250,2025-04-11 06:04:21.000,"I'm having trouble transferring my tickets for next Friday's electronic dance show at The Prism.

162,769,2025-03-05 05:28:45.000,"I've been a loyal customer of your platform for several years now, primarily attending electronic and techno events. Recently, I noticed that the frequency of underground warehouse events has significantly decreased in the past 3 months. While I understand this might be due to seasonal changes, I really miss those intimate, raw experiences that made your venue special."
113,300,2025-01-25 23:02:27.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention that I've noticed fewer jazz events being scheduled lately. As someone who's been attending your venues for the past 3 years, particularly for jazz and blues nights, it's been disappointing to see them becoming less frequent. The intimate setting at your downtown location is perfect for these genres, and the acoustics are fantastic. Any chance you'll be bringing back more jazz programming?"
46,303,2025-01-26 07:24:54.000,"While I'm here, I'd also like to mention that I love how you've increased the frequency of Latin jazz performances lately - they're always a highlight! That said, the sound quality during last week's performance was a bit off, with too much bass drowning out the horn section. Just thought you should know."
102,1090,2025-03-29 09:06:59.000,"This is particularly frustrating because I spent $289 on this ticket, and now that I can't make it due to a family wedding, I really need to get this sorted. Sarah is a massive techno fan and she's dying to see DJ Starlight's set."
163,1555,2025-05-04 19:57:42.000,"I recently attended your blues night at Downtown Music Hall last Saturday, and while the overall atmosphere was incredible (I especially loved the acoustic set in the second half!), I'm writing because I've noticed some concerning patterns with the ticketing system lately. I've been a regular attendee for about 2 years now, but the frequency of events seems to have decreased significantly in the past few months. We used to have blues nights every other weekend, but now it's become quite unpredictable."

I've attached a video showing the audio issues."
142,220,2025-01-19 02:06:32.000,"While I'm here, I wanted to mention that I absolutely love the direction you're taking with booking more indie rock and alternative acts lately. The underground garage rock scene really resonates with me, though I'd love to see more psychedelic rock bands in the lineup too. However, I feel the frequency of shows has dropped significantly since last fall - we used to get 3-4 great shows per week, now we're lucky to see one every other week."

132,761,2025-03-04 17:43:11.000,"One more thing - the mobile ticket transfer feature isn't working properly on my Android phone. When I try to send a ticket to my friend, it keeps showing an error message saying ""Transfer failed - please try again later"" (screenshot attached). I've tried both WiFi and mobile data, but no luck."
49,111,2025-01-10 01:13:30.000,"Also, quick feedback - the new mobile app is quite buggy when trying to access the digital tickets. Sometimes it takes up to 5 minutes to load, which caused some anxiety at the entrance last time."
132,86,2025-01-08 01:33:34.000,"I've been trying to transfer my tickets for next month's electronic music festival to my friend Sarah, but I keep getting an error message every time I attempt the transfer (screenshot attached). The loading circle just spins endlessly, and then I get kicked back to the main page. I've tried both on my phone and laptop, using different browsers, but no luck."
151,1773,2025-05-23 04:24:24.000,"Also, I noticed that the new membership tier system is a bit unclear - particularly regarding early access benefits. For example, I'm a Gold member but somehow wasn't able to access the pre-sale for the ""Midnight Symphony"" show last week, despite the membership benefits page stating all Gold members get pre-sale access."
24,366,2025-01-30 16:10:25.000,"While I'm writing, I wanted to mention that I absolutely love the new layout of your mobile app, especially how easy it is to filter events by genre. However, I've noticed fewer drum & bass events lately. Any plans to bring more d&b artists to the venue?"
165,1359,2025-04-19 01:44:43.000,"Could you please:
1. Help resolve the ticket transfer issue ASAP
2. Let me know if the World Beat series will return
3. Confirm if my payment from last week's cancelled show has been refunded (order #RT789456)"
49,1326,2025-04-16 22:48:22.000,"I absolutely love electronic music and have been attending your events for the past 3 years - the underground techno showcase last October was absolutely incredible! That's why I'm particularly disappointed about missing this one. I've noticed you've been hosting fewer electronic music events lately, shifting more towards indie rock. While I understand the need to cater to different audiences, it would be amazing if you could bring back more regular electronic music nights, especially those intimate warehouse settings that made your events so special."
35,1500,2025-04-30 17:28:09.000,"I've been trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming indie folk concert at Mountain View Hall next Friday to my sister's account, but I keep getting an error message saying ""transfer limit exceeded"" even though this is my first time attempting a transfer. I've attached a screenshot of the error page for reference."
49,1347,2025-04-18 03:37:15.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention that I absolutely love the new monthly acoustic sessions you've been hosting! The intimate setting is perfect, though it would be amazing if you could consider doing them twice a month instead of just once. The last one I attended was completely sold out, and I know several friends who couldn't get tickets."
150,1549,2025-05-04 06:01:08.000,"One suggestion: it would be amazing if you could add more trance artists to the lineup. The bass music is great, but some variety would be wonderful."
65,1558,2025-05-04 23:50:39.000,"The venue staff was helpful and eventually let us in after a 45-minute wait, but we missed the opening act. While the main performances were incredible (especially that sunset set!), I feel we should be compensated for missing part of the show we paid for. "
166,1779,2025-05-23 13:23:26.000,"I'd really appreciate if you could:
1. Look into the ticket transfer issue
2. Confirm if there's been a policy change regarding jazz events
3. Refund my second payment for the December 15th event (confirmation #RT789321)"
39,1520,2025-05-02 09:33:20.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention that I've been a regular attendee at your monthly jazz nights for the past year, and I particularly love the intimate setting of your basement venue. The acoustics are fantastic! However, lately it feels like these events have become less frequent - we used to have them every first Friday, but the last two months were skipped without notice. Any chance you could keep us updated about scheduling changes through your newsletter?"
119,1757,2025-05-22 10:16:40.000,"I'm experiencing a really frustrating issue with my ticket transfer for the upcoming Electronic Paradise Festival (October 15-17). I've been trying to transfer my VIP pass to my sister since I unfortunately can't make it anymore due to a family wedding. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep getting whenever I click the ""Transfer Ticket"" button on your website. It just keeps saying ""Transfer unavailable at this time"" even though I purchased these tickets way back in March."
28,1737,2025-05-21 01:17:25.000,"While I have you, I also wanted to mention how much I've been enjoying your new venue's indie rock lineup on Thursday nights. The acoustics are fantastic, especially for drum-heavy performances! However, I noticed these shows have become less frequent lately - they used to be weekly but now seem to happen only twice a month. Any chance of bringing them back to a weekly schedule? The local indie scene really needs this platform."
149,33,2025-01-04 02:38:30.000,"Please help me with the ticket transfer issue as soon as possible, as I need to confirm arrangements with my sister."
38,920,2025-03-16 09:13:41.000,One last thing - the new merchandise booth layout is so much better! Being able to browse artist merch without losing my spot for the shows was fantastic.
45,1434,2025-04-25 13:14:53.000,"Also, quick suggestion - it would be amazing if you could add a jazz fusion series to your lineup. I know there's a growing jazz scene in the city, and venues like yours would be perfect for it."
149,1320,2025-04-16 11:39:09.000,"Additionally, I wanted to provide some feedback about the new notification system. As someone who primarily listens to indie rock and alternative music, I'm getting bombarded with notifications about country music events. While I appreciate staying informed about upcoming shows, it would be great if the notifications were more tailored to my interests based on my previous ticket purchases or maybe a preference setting I could adjust."
95,671,2025-02-24 06:36:40.000,"Also, there seems to be an issue with your mobile app's notification system. I've enabled notifications but haven't received any alerts about upcoming electronic music shows, which I specifically marked as my preferred genre."
4,616,2025-02-20 05:39:24.000,"I attended yesterday's electronic music festival at Riverside Arena and wanted to share my experience. While DJ MoonPhase's set was absolutely incredible (I'm a huge trance fan!), I encountered several issues that really impacted my evening."
22,961,2025-03-19 02:17:46.000,"I recently attended the ""Neon Beats Festival"" last weekend, and while the overall experience was incredible (especially that jaw-dropping drum solo during Lunar Eclipse's set!), I've been having issues with transferring my tickets for the upcoming ""Winter Symphony Series."" I purchased 3 tickets for the December 18th show, but my friends can't make it anymore due to a schedule conflict. I've tried transferring them throught the app for the past two days, but keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). The error occurs specifically when I click the ""Transfer to Friend"" button."
6,1614,2025-05-09 11:45:10.000,"Also, quick heads up - the mobile app has been crashing whenever I try to access my digital tickets. Not sure if others are experiencing this too?"
44,1256,2025-04-11 15:42:39.000,"I've been trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming Summer Fusion Festival (3 tickets, Row B) to my cousin since I unexpectedly need to travel for work that weekend. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep getting when attempting the transfer through your app. It's incredibly frustrating as I'm a huge indie folk fan and had specifically bought these tickets to see the acoustic sets at the Woodland Stage."
32,1416,2025-04-24 04:20:25.000,"On a different note, I accidentally purchased two tickets for the upcoming experimental electronic show next month (screenshot of double booking attached). Is it possible to get a refund for one of them? Order #RT789321."
14,716,2025-02-27 23:46:49.000,"Firstly, the ticket transfer process was a nightmare. I tried transferring my Saturday pass to my friend when I got sick, but the app kept crashing. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I kept receiving. After attempting for 3 hours, I had to give up, and my friend couldn't attend."
91,233,2025-01-19 18:29:04.000,"I'm experiencing a really frustrating issue with my ticket transfer for the upcoming Midnight Symphony concert this Saturday. I've been trying to transfer my VIP ticket to my sister since yesterday, but every time I click the ""Transfer"" button, the app just keeps loading and nothing happens. I've attached a screenshot showing the endless loading screen."
126,1485,2025-04-29 07:12:24.000,Could you please help me with these issues? The ticket transfer is my main concern right now.
2,1653,2025-05-13 01:41:33.000,"Also, while I have your attention - any chance you'll be hosting more Latin jazz events soon? The quarterly schedule seems a bit sparse for that genre lately."
153,1153,2025-04-03 18:07:55.000,"While I have your attention, I wanted to mention that I absolutely love what you've been doing with the underground techno scene lately! The warehouse events every second Saturday are exactly what this city needed. However, I noticed the frequency of drum & bass events has decreased since summer. Any chance we could get more of those? The last one with that sick lineup of local DJs was pure fire!"
13,1292,2025-04-13 21:04:59.000,"Also, I noticed that the folk/indie events seem to have become less frequent in the past few months. As someone who regularly attended these shows (I was at almost every one last summer!), I really miss the intimate atmosphere of these performances. Any chance we'll see more of these soon? The electronic music events are great too, but nothing beats the warmth of acoustic guitars and harmonies."
125,1611,2025-05-08 23:49:16.000,"One suggestion: it would be great if you could introduce some world music performances, particularly Indian classical or African percussion. I think it would add wonderful diversity to your already amazing lineup."
10,978,2025-03-20 02:09:01.000,"I attended the Neon Pulse Festival last weekend and wanted to share some mixed feedback. While the electronic acts were phenomenal (especially loving the progressive house sets!), I had major issues with the ticketing system. I purchased 4 VIP tickets for my friends and me, but when I tried to transfer 2 tickets to my friends, the app kept showing an error. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I kept receiving."
80,1480,2025-04-28 06:07:03.000,"I've been a regular attendee at your events for the past 3 years - especially love your underground techno series - and this is the first time I'm experiencing such issues. The lineup for this festival looks amazing, particularly excited about the late-night jungle music showcase, and I'd hate for these tickets to go to waste."
129,989,2025-03-21 01:40:35.000,"Lastly, there seems to be a discrepancy in my account regarding a refund from the canceled Jazz & Soul event last month. The email said it would be processed within 5-7 business days, but it's been two weeks now. Could you please look into this? I've attached a screenshot of my original purchase confirmation for reference."
119,1296,2025-04-14 12:34:12.000,"I hope this finds you well. I've been experiencing some frustrating issues with my ticket transfer for the upcoming electronic music festival on July 15th. I've tried transferring my VIP pass to my sister's account three times now, but keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). The loading circle just spins endlessly, and then I get kicked back to the main page."
18,789,2025-03-06 12:30:28.000,"Could you please help me with the ticket transfer issue as soon as possible? The show is in 3 weeks, and I want to make sure my sister can get in without any problems."
8,180,2025-01-15 20:49:40.000,"Could you please help me with the ticket transfer issue as soon as possible? The show is next Friday, and I want to make sure my sister can attend. I've already paid $89 for the ticket, and it would be a shame for it to go to waste."
99,749,2025-03-03 10:42:41.000,"While I have your attention - the new cashless payment system at the venue is fantastic, but could you please consider adding Apple Pay? It would make the drink purchases so much smoother."
71,653,2025-02-22 22:48:06.000,"I also experienced some issues with the sound quality during last month's electronic music showcase - the bass was overwhelming in the back section where the VIP area was located. Several others mentioned this too, so might be worth looking into."
9,721,2025-02-28 09:11:53.000,"Can you please help me with the ticket transfer issue ASAP? If transferring isn't possible, I'd like to know my refund options. The tickets weren't cheap and I'd rather not take the loss."
53,1766,2025-05-22 20:14:44.000,"On a separate note, I really appreciate how you've been increasing the frequency of indie electronic artists in your lineup recently. The intimate setting of your smaller stage really enhances the experimental electronic performances. However, I feel the drink prices during premium events have become a bit steep - $15 for a basic cocktail is pushing it."
65,1768,2025-05-22 21:40:16.000,"Also, I notice you've reduced the frequency of trance events in the past few months. As someone who particularly enjoys the genre, I'd love to see more options. The current bi-monthly schedule isn't enough to satisfy the growing trance community here."
112,732,2025-03-01 14:35:12.000,"However, I have two questions:
1. I noticed next year's early bird tickets are already on sale, but the frequency of the event isn't clear. Will it be quarterly like this year or monthly as rumored on social media?
2. I bought an extra VIP ticket for my sister, but she can't make it anymore. What's your policy on ticket transfers? I checked the FAQ but couldn't find specific information about VIP tickets."
48,337,2025-01-28 19:27:33.000,"That being said, your staff is always fantastic, especially the security team. They handled a situation really well during last week's jazz night when someone was trying to record the performance despite the no-recording policy."
135,1844,2025-05-28 21:15:41.000,"I attended last night's jazz fusion concert at the Downtown Arena and wanted to share my experience. While the musicianship was exceptional (especially during that mind-blowing saxophone solo!), I encountered several issues that need addressing."
57,632,2025-02-21 10:51:53.000,"Also, the new paperless ticket system is generally great, but the app has been super glitchy lately. Sometimes it takes forever to load my QR code at the entrance, which was particularly embarrassing at last month's drum & bass night when there was a huge line behind me."
59,1781,2025-05-23 14:37:01.000,"Could you please help me sort out this transfer issue ASAP? The festival is only 3 weeks away, and my friend needs to arrange travel."
129,1399,2025-04-22 06:40:55.000,"On a separate note, I processed a refund for the cancelled Electronic Music Festival three weeks ago but haven't received the money back yet. The confirmation number is TXN-2023-89472. Could you please look into this?"
45,236,2025-01-19 21:21:01.000,"Additionally, I purchased VIP tickets ($225 each) for my girlfriend and me, but the VIP area was overcrowded and many amenities mentioned in the package (private bar access, complimentary welcome drink) were unavailable. When I spoke with the event staff, they seemed unaware of these promised benefits."
98,949,2025-03-18 10:44:26.000,Back to my main issue though - could you please help me with the ticket transfer? I've already promised these tickets to my sister and don't want to let her down.
7,1557,2025-05-04 22:48:42.000,"Also, while I have your attention - I noticed you've reduced the frequency of jazz events in the Downtown Music Hall. Any chance you'll be bringing back the weekly jazz nights? Those were my favorite way to spend Thursday evenings."
98,185,2025-01-16 06:36:32.000,"Also, quick suggestion - it would be amazing if you could add a psytrance night to your regular rotation. The closest events are usually 2 hours away, and I know there's a growing community here who would support it."
159,498,2025-02-10 17:45:02.000,"I've been trying to transfer my tickets for the upcoming electronic music festival at Crystal Gardens next month to my sister, but I keep getting an error message saying ""transfer limit exceeded"" even though this is my first attempt at transferring tickets this year. I've attached a screenshot of the error page for your reference."
18,574,2025-02-16 17:23:57.000,"While I'm here, I also wanted to mention that as a regular attendee of your indie rock events (I'm particularly fond of the monthly Underground Sessions), I've noticed the frequency has decreased lately. We used to have these intimate shows every second Friday, but now it seems more sporadic. The atmosphere at these events is always incredible, and they're perfect for discovering new local talent."
139,681,2025-02-24 22:13:35.000,"Also, I purchased VIP passes for the summer music series, but my confirmation email shows standard admission. I paid $189.50 for each pass (3 in total), and I'd appreciate if someone could verify this was processed correctly."
8,497,2025-02-10 17:43:56.000,"I recently attended the Neon Dreams concert at your downtown venue, and the sound system seemed a bit off - there was too much bass drowning out the vocals. I've been to many shows there before and this was the first time I noticed this issue."
75,857,2025-03-10 23:27:41.000,"Finally, I was wondering about your refund policy. I bought tickets for the upcoming world music festival next month, but I just found out I'll be traveling for work. The screenshot I attached shows my purchase confirmation - would it be possible to get a refund or at least a credit for a future event?"
31,1647,2025-05-12 15:36:56.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention that I really miss the monthly underground techno nights you used to host at The Blue Room. The quarterly events just aren't enough for us die-hard fans! The intimate venue and stellar sound system were perfect for those deep, dark techno sets. Any chance you'll bring back the monthly frequency?"
140,1408,2025-04-23 03:59:32.000,"While I have you, I also wanted to mention that I absolutely love the new jazz performances you've been hosting on Thursday nights. The intimate venue setting is perfect for that genre, and the local artists you're featuring are incredibly talented. However, I noticed these shows are becoming less frequent - they used to be weekly but now seem to be monthly. Any chance you could bring back the weekly schedule? The jazz community here would really appreciate it!"
17,577,2025-02-16 23:30:30.000,"Also, while I have your attention - I love how you've been bringing more world music artists to the venue lately, but could we possibly get some more jazz fusion shows? The last jazz event you hosted was about 8 months ago, and the local jazz community is pretty active here."
110,1032,2025-03-24 19:43:34.000,"I'm writing because I recently attended the ""Midnight Symphony"" concert last weekend, and while most aspects were amazing (especially the brass section!), I've noticed I was charged twice for my ticket purchase. I've attached a screenshot of both transactions from my credit card statement showing the duplicate charge of $89.50 each from March 15th."
66,1877,2025-05-31 11:34:39.000,"I've been a loyal customer of your venue for years (the underground techno nights are absolutely my favorite - especially that mind-blowing set last month with those deep house transitions!), so it's really frustrating that I can't seem to get this sorted out."
103,800,2025-03-07 08:54:38.000,"On a different note, your new booking interface is much better than the old one - kudos to whoever designed it! However, it would be great if you could add a filter for instrumental-only performances. As someone who particularly enjoys post-rock and ambient music, this would make it much easier to find the shows I'm interested in."
30,670,2025-02-24 02:47:36.000,"Also, I noticed you've reduced the frequency of drum & bass nights from bi-weekly to monthly. Any chance you'll bring back the more frequent schedule? The community really misses those mid-week sessions - they were perfect for breaking up the work week, and the smaller crowd actually created a better vibe for practicing our footwork."
29,1462,2025-04-27 13:53:10.000,"Also, quick heads up - there seems to be a glitch in your mobile app where the venue map isn't loading properly for upcoming shows. I've attached another screenshot showing what I'm seeing."
18,1535,2025-05-03 07:52:05.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that it would be great if you could consider hosting more jazz fusion events. I've noticed they're quite rare in the calendar, maybe only one every 3-4 months? The last fusion concert I attended at your venue had such amazing acoustics, especially during the saxophone solos."
28,302,2025-01-26 05:02:48.000,"I particularly love how you're branching out into experimental jazz lately, though I'd suggest starting those shows a bit earlier than 10 PM since they tend to attract an older crowd (myself included!)."
43,935,2025-03-17 06:16:30.000,"I recently attended your underground techno event at The Underground Room last Friday, and while the music was absolutely incredible (especially that deep house set around midnight!), I'm having some issues with getting a refund for my friend's ticket. She couldn't make it last minute due to a family emergency, and I tried using your ticket transfer system, but kept getting an error message. I've attached a screenshot of the error page for your reference."
156,14,2025-01-01 23:48:16.000,"I'm having trouble transferring my concert tickets to my sister for the upcoming jazz fusion show at Harmony Hall next Friday. I've been a loyal customer and attended numerous events through your platform, particularly the experimental jazz series, but this is the first time I've encountered this issue. When I click the ""transfer tickets"" button, I keep getting an error message (screenshot attached)."
76,1572,2025-05-06 09:24:25.000,"The sound quality at my last visit (the Brazilian fusion concert two weeks ago) was absolutely top-notch, by the way. Your new sound system really brings out those subtle percussion details."
159,449,2025-02-06 11:44:08.000,"While I'm here, I wanted to also mention that I absolutely love what you're doing with the new monthly underground jazz series! As a huge bebop enthusiast, it's refreshing to see these intimate venues getting more attention. However, I noticed that lately the shows have been scheduled only once every two months instead of monthly as initially advertised. Any chance we could get back to the monthly frequency? The community that's building around these events is incredible, and we're all craving more regular meetups."
22,842,2025-03-09 21:53:11.000,"This is particularly frustrating because I've been following the headlining band since their early days playing in coffee shops, and I really don't want to miss their biggest show yet. Their acoustic sets always give me goosebumps!"
52,795,2025-03-07 00:00:01.000,"I also encountered an issue with my tickets that I need help resolving. I purchased 3 VIP tickets (Order #VIP-2023-89742) for my friends and me, but one friend couldn't make it last minute due to a family emergency. I tried transferring the ticket to another friend through your app, but kept getting an error message (screenshot attached). The error appears every time I click ""Transfer Ticket"" - it just loads indefinitely with a spinning wheel."
159,288,2025-01-24 21:59:59.000,"While I have your attention, I also wanted to mention that it would be great if you could bring more drum and bass artists to your Thursday night events. The jazz and indie rock lineups are fantastic, but some of us bass heads are craving more variety!"
60,290,2025-01-25 01:02:17.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that I really miss the weekly blues nights you used to host. The intimate setting was perfect for that genre, and the rotating local artists kept things fresh and exciting. Any chance these might make a comeback? The current monthly electronic music events are great (that underground techno set last week was fire!), but some of us old-school blues lovers would love to see more frequent blues programming."
4,1581,2025-05-06 20:52:43.000,"I've been attending shows at your venue for the past 2 years and absolutely love the indie rock scene you've cultivated. However, I'm really frustrated with my recent experience trying to transfer tickets for the upcoming Underground Echoes festival. I purchased 4 VIP tickets ($225 each) for my friends and me, but two of them can't make it anymore due to a family emergency."
91,1515,2025-05-01 20:13:46.000,"Also, quick feedback - I noticed you've reduced the frequency of drum & bass events in the south venue. Any chance we could get more of those back? The community really misses them!"
86,231,2025-01-19 17:41:25.000,"While I'm here, I'd also like to mention that the frequency of trance events in your venue has decreased significantly over the past year. As someone who regularly attended your Thursday night trance sessions, I miss having a consistent spot to enjoy this genre. The new focus on pop-up jazz nights is great for variety, but perhaps you could consider alternating between genres?"
87,962,2025-03-19 02:29:34.000,"I've been having trouble with my ticket transfer for next month's jazz festival at Riverside. I attempted to transfer my VIP pass to my sister's account three times now, but keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). The error occurs right after I enter her email and click ""confirm transfer."" I've already checked that her email is correct and that she has a registered account."
3,1012,2025-03-23 07:32:47.000,"I've been trying to transfer my VIP ticket for the upcoming Moonlit Symphony Festival on Sept 15th to my sister since I unexpectedly have to travel for work. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I keep getting when I click the ""Transfer Ticket"" button on your website. It's really frustrating because I paid $289 for this ticket and I absolutely don't want it to go to waste."
117,1798,2025-05-25 08:28:01.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention that I've noticed fewer jazz events lately in your venue. As someone who's been a regular attendee for the past three years, particularly for bebop and contemporary jazz shows, it would be amazing to see more of these events. The acoustics in your hall are perfect for jazz performances, especially for smaller ensemble pieces."
83,1242,2025-04-10 20:48:16.000,"Also, what's with reducing the frequency of jazz nights at The Blue Room? Those intimate Thursday sessions were the highlight of my month, especially when you featured local artists. The new bi-monthly schedule just isn't enough for us jazz enthusiasts. I particularly miss the improvisational segments."
128,1592,2025-05-07 20:48:24.000,"I also wanted to mention that while I absolutely love the quality of artists you're booking lately, especially for the techno warehouse series, it would be great to see more frequent events during weekdays. Some of us work weekends, and I personally miss those Wednesday night sessions you used to host at The Circuit venue last year."

I've attempted the transfer through your app three times now, but keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). The error appears right after I enter her email address and click ""Transfer."""

I've attempted the transfer through your app three times now, but keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). The tickets weren't cheap - $289 each - and I really need this sorted out soon as the festival is in two weeks."
154,1196,2025-04-07 08:24:44.000,"While I'm writing, I also wanted to mention that I really appreciate how you've been bringing more techno and deep house artists to your venues lately. The quality of sound at your events has been consistently great - especially that new Function One system! However, I do wish you would host more Sunday afternoon events. Some of us have to work Monday mornings, and those late Friday night shows can be tough to manage."
15,607,2025-02-19 05:35:02.000,"This is really frustrating because  I spent $385 on these VIP passes and the festival is in just 10 days. I've been looking forward to seeing the sunset DJ set and that new underground techno artist from Berlin, but my boss just scheduled an unavoidable business trip. I really need to get these tickets transferred ASAP."
92,917,2025-03-16 05:40:09.000,I look forward to hearing back from you about both the ticket transfer issue and my suggestions regarding event scheduling.

I've followed all the steps in your FAQ, but when I click ""confirm transfer,"" the loading circle just spins endlessly. This is super frustrating since I paid quite a bit for these VIP passes ($225 each), and I really need to get these transferred ASAP since I unexpectedly have to travel for work."
125,930,2025-03-17 01:53:06.000,"This is especially frustrating because I'm a huge techno fan and I've been to every summer festival you've organized since 2019. The lineup this year looks incredible, and I don't want Sarah to miss out just because of technical issues. She's particularly excited about the underground warehouse stage."
146,838,2025-03-09 13:26:58.000,"I've been trying to transfer my ticket for the upcoming electronic music festival at Moonlight Gardens next month to my friend Sarah, but I keep getting an error message when I attempt it through your website. I've attached a screenshot of the error page - it keeps saying ""transfer failed"" even though I've double-checked all the information is correct. This is really stressing me out since I can't make it anymore due to a family emergency, and Sarah was really looking forward to seeing DJ Starlight's set."
77,1426,2025-04-24 23:01:23.000,"I've been having the most frustrating experience trying to transfer my tickets for next weekend's jazz fusion concert at The Blue Room. I purchased 2 VIP tickets ($189 each) for myself and my sister, but she's no longer able to attend due to a family emergency. I've tried transferring the tickets to my friend's account for the past 3 hours, but keep getting an ""Error 405"" message. I've attached a screenshot of the error page for your reference."
114,1599,2025-05-08 06:43:07.000,"Could you please help me resolve this transfer problem? Also, any chance you'll bring back the regular Wednesday night live music sessions? The underground rock scene here really misses them."
22,1801,2025-05-25 12:31:48.000,"Also, while I have your attention - I noticed that your venue hasn't hosted any jazz events in the past few months. As someone who religiously attended your Thursday night jazz sessions last year, I really miss these intimate performances. Any chance you'll be bringing them back?"
