# Getting Started with Cortex AI Functions

## Overview

Cortex AI Functions reimagines SQL into an AI query language for multimodal data, bringing powerful AI capabilities directly into Snowflake's SQL engine. It enables users to build scalable AI pipelines across text, images, and audio using familiar SQL commands and with industry-leading LLMs from Google, Open AI, Anthropic, Meta, and more. With native support for multimodal data through a new FILE datatype, Cortex AI Functions seamlessly integrates AI operators with traditional SQL primitives like AI_FILTER and AGGREGATE, allowing analysts to process diverse data types more efficiently and cost-effectively while maintaining enterprise-grade security and governance.
